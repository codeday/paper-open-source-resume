The fluidity of careers also requires a greater emphasis on the development of metacognitive and reflective abilities so that graduates will have the capability, capacity, and confidence to use their personal resources appropriately and flexibly, regardless of environment. The research presented herein aimed to understand more about the employability skills viewed as important by four stakeholder groups - academics, students, graduates and industry - whilst also gauging perceived levels of attainment and confidence in those skills. The confidence and capability of academics to prepare Science students to be career ready was explored by conducting surveys and community-of-practice style workshops. The perspectives of industry employers, students, and graduates was sought via surveys, workshop and/or focus groups. In general, the ranking of the importance of employability skills was similar regardless of stakeholder group. Effective communication, effective management of time and working within a team were commonly deemed most important, while all groups ranked leadership skills and conflict resolution as of lesser importance. However, industry felt that ability to work independently, effectively communicate and time management skills were least likely to have been attained by Science graduates. This contrasted with most graduates indicating they were more confident in having attained these skills, and academics indicating they were more confident to teach these skills. A lack of career awareness was also identified, with many students changing their perspectives on career pathways after interactions with industry.},

In this work we present our experience on establishing open source development from student contributors as part of their university curriculum. Since 2010 more than 300 students from Graz University of Technology have been involved in the presented Catrobat project and have gained knowledge about agile software development as well as several related domains, e.g., project management, marketing, or graphical design. In this paper we provide detailed insights into the project’s organization and evaluate in a study how students feel in this setting. As we conclude, bringing open source to university courses is an effective practical approach based on social learning and provides benefits for students and researchers.},

Objective: This study aims to summarize existing information on how open source projects have been used to facilitate students' learning of software engineering. Method: A systematic mapping study was undertaken by identifying, filtering and classifying primary studies using a predefined strategy. Results: 53 papers were selected and classified. The main results were: a) most studies focus on comprehensive software engineering courses, although some papers deal with specific areas; b) the most prevalent approach was the traditional project method; c) surveys are the main learning assessment instrument, especially for student self-assessment; d) conferences are the typical publication venue; and e) more than half of the studies were published in the last five years. Conclusions: The resulting map gives an overview of the existing initiatives in this context and shows gaps where further research can be pursued.},

Selecting a project for the students to work on is one of these challenges. Solutions to this challenge have included “toy” projects for which the instructor is the client, or “service learning” projects for which an outside organization is the client. A rather unique opportunity was presented to the students in the Computing and Information Science Department at Saint Vincent College, a small liberal arts college in southwestern Pennsylvania. An Information Technology solutions company oﬀered to provide a small computer lab in which students could work as interns for the company on-campus and coordinate their work with existing courses. Although this collaboration presented many challenges of its own, the internships have been incorporated into the department’s curriculum as course projects for the systems analysis and design, software engineering and senior capstone courses. The collaboration has been immensely beneﬁcial in providing students with industry experience in all aspects of software development during their college years.},

	abstract = {This Innovative Practice Work in Progress paper reports on a pilot program to support HBCU undergraduates in learning about open source software contribution. Offered in the Summer of 2023, this program was called Contributor Catalyst. This program was designed to support students who had completed foundational computing coursework (i.e. intro-ductory programming, data structures), but were still evaluating future education and career pathways. We served four HBCU undergraduates from the same institution in our pilot year. The program offered mentorship, instruction, and community-building through a hybrid-modality cohort model, in which students spent one week learning remotely, four weeks together in-person on an Rl residential campus, and then three more weeks collaborating remotely. Roughly the first half of the program was spent learning about open source tools, practices, and norms; the second half was spent contributing to p5js, a real world project which the students chose from a vetted list of options. Community-building events were highlighted during the in-person portion of the program, for example: welcome and departure dinners, regional excursions, and participating in a Black Lives Matter garden workday. Students also participated in professional development such as attending an academic research conference and visiting a tech company. Student learning was scaffolded by workshop-style instruction and was further supported by a layered community of practice. This community of practice included peer support from within the cohort, program support from their instructor, and project support from p5js community members. Students also had many opportunities to engage with guests including project maintainers, faculty members, and industry professionals, all working in the realm of open source. This paper offers an early report on our experiences and suggests how the program might evolve and grow in future years. In particular, we hope to build partnerships with additional HB-CUs, document and share our program resources, and evaluate programmatic goals.},

The authors themselves have identified that many researchers who purport to adhere to this approach—and who reference their work as such—fail to adhere fully to the principles of ‘reflexive thematic analysis’ (RTA). Over the course of numerous publications, Braun and Clarke have elaborated significantly upon the constitution of RTA and attempted to clarify numerous misconceptions that they have found in the literature. This paper will offer a worked example of Braun and Clarke’s contemporary approach to reflexive thematic analysis with the aim of helping to dispel some of the confusion regarding the position of RTA among the numerous existing typologies of TA. While the data used in the worked example has been garnered from health and wellbeing education research and was examined to ascertain educators’ attitudes regarding such, the example offered of how to implement the RTA would be easily transferable to many other contexts and research topics.},

Through mentoring, newcomers learn to acquire essential technical, social, and organizational skills. Despite the importance of OSS mentors, they are understudied in the literature. Understanding who OSS project mentors are, the challenges they face, and the strategies they use can help OSS projects better support mentors’ work. In this paper, we employ a two-stage study to comprehensively investigate mentors in OSS. First, we identify the characteristics of mentors in the Apache Software Foundation, a large OSS community, using an online survey. We found that less experienced volunteer contributors are less likely to take on the mentorship role. Second, through interviews with OSS mentors (n=18), we identify the challenges that mentors face and how they mitigate them. In total, we identified 25 general mentorship challenges and 7 sub-categories of challenges regarding task recommendation. We also identified 13 strategies to overcome the challenges related to task recommendation. Our results provide insights for OSS communities, formal mentorship programs, and tool builders who design automated support for task assignment and internship.},

To attract newcomers and facilitate their onboarding, many OSS projects recommend tasks for newcomers, such as good first issues (GFIs). Previous studies have preliminarily investigated the effects of GFIs and techniques to identify suitable GFIs. However, it is still unclear whether just recommending tasks is enough and how significant mentoring is for newcomers. To better understand mentoring in OSS communities, we analyze the resolution process of 48,402 GFIs from 964 repositories through a mix-method approach. We investigate the extent, the mentorship structures, the discussed topics, and the relevance of expert involvement. We find that {\textasciitilde}70\% of GFIs have expert participation, with each GFI usually having one expert who makes two comments. Half of GFIs will receive their first expert comment within 8.5 hours after a newcomer comment. Through analysis of the collaboration networks of newcomers and experts, we observe that community mentorship presents four types of structure: centralized mentoring, decentralized mentoring, collaborative mentoring, and distributed mentoring. As for discussed topics, we identify 14 newcomer challenges and 18 expert mentoring content. By fitting the generalized linear models, we find that expert involvement positively correlates with newcomers' successful contributions but negatively correlates with newcomers' retention. Our study manifests the status and significance of mentoring in the OSS projects, which provides rich practical implications for optimizing the mentoring process and helping newcomers contribute smoothly and successfully.},

	abstract = {Context: Mentoring in Open Source Software (OSS) is important to its project's growth and sustainability. Mentoring allows contributors to improve their technical skills and learn about the protocols and cultural norms of the project. However, mentoring has its challenges: mentors sometimes feel unappreciated, and mentees may have mismatched interests or lack interpersonal skills. Existing research has investigated the different challenges of mentoring in different OSS contexts, but we lack a holistic understanding. Objective: A comprehensive understanding of the current practices and challenges of mentoring in OSS is needed to implement appropriate strategies to facilitate mentoring. Method: This study presents a systematic literature review investigating how literature has characterized mentoring practices in OSS, including their challenges and the strategies to mitigate them. We retrieved 232 studies from four digital libraries. Out of these, 21 were primary studies. Using this, we performed backward and author snowballing, adding another 27 studies. We conducted a completeness check by reviewing the references of the 4 most relevant primary studies, which resulted in us adding 1 additional study. We then conducted a full-text review and evaluated the studies using a set of criteria; as a result, 10 papers were excluded. We then employed an open-coding approach to analyze, aggregate, and synthesize the selected studies. Results: We reviewed 39 studies to investigate the different facets of mentoring in OSS, encompassing motivations, goals, channels, and contributor dynamics. We then identified 13 challenges associated with mentoring in OSS, which fall into three categories: social, process, and technical. We also present a quick-reference strategy catalog to map these strategies to challenges for mitigation. Conclusions: Our study serves as a guideline for researchers and practitioners about mentoring challenges and potential strategies to mitigate these challenges.},

	abstract = {This report details findings of an evaluation of the TechConnect Capstone at Green River College where mentors from industry lead groups of underserved computer science students through an open-source software project, creating an innovative work-based learning opportunity.

Internships during computer science (CS) programs are vital in helping college students secure high-paying jobs in the tech industry upon graduation. However, internships are often rife with inequity, making it difficult for adult learners, lower income students, and other minoritized populations to access these coveted roles.

To bring vital work-based learning to their CS students, Green River College (GRC), Mentors in Tech (MinT), and CodeDay collaborated to develop a new work-based learning model, TechConnect Capstone (TCC). With TCC, CS students work in teams on an open-source software project and are paired with mentors, who are currently professionals in tech fields. Mentors guide students as they work through their open-source projects, helping students solve problems, adopt workplace-appropriate solutions and approaches to problems, and keep pace in their work progress.

This brief provides a developmental evaluation of the TCC model. The goal of the evaluation was to understand: (a) In what ways, if at all, the TCC model has been impactful for students and staff; (b) in what ways, if at all, the project had contributed to equitable outcomes for underserved populations; and (c) in what ways the TCC model can be improved.

Through the evaluation, we learned that students found the TCC projects relevant, particularly in terms of communication, teamwork, project management, and developing computer language proficiency. All students shared that they felt better prepared for a job having participated in the TCC model and more prepared to tackle the job market after the capstone project course. This mode of internship was also helpful to adult students and those who may not have otherwise been able to complete traditional internships. Additionally, faculty and staff found that using open-source projects over traditional employer internships was a key for the TCC model’s success, particularly because of the way the open-source projects simulate a workplace experience. They also stressed the importance of mentors in the TCC model because of the structure and feedback they provide. Instructors also saw growth in students, including students’ confidence and engagement in the project. We find that the TCC model has shown effectiveness at GRC. TCC gives students real-world experience in new software, in working with a collaborative, professional team, and in learning methods that are of a workplace caliber. This mentored, open-source project model might overcome some of the challenges associated with traditional internships while still providing valuable experience and contacts, especially for underserved students and adult learners.

The Building Open Source Opportunities for Students in Tech (BOOST) initiative was formerly referred to and written about as the TechConnect Capstone (TCC). TCC and BOOST represent the same work but under different names.},

	abstract = {Building Open Source Opportunities for Students in Tech (BOOST) is a new and innovative capstone project at Green River College (GRC) that was designed in response to pandemic-era challenges and inequities in computer science internships. Developed in partnership with Mentors in Tech (MinT) and CodeDay, BOOST pairs students with industry mentors to complete open source software projects within a capstone course sequence. Students work 10–15 hours weekly, both in class and with mentors, gaining technical training, professional guidance, and a paid, flexible experience — experience that is critical for adult learners, low-income students, and others who face barriers to traditional internships.

BOOST now has graduates who have been in the workforce for one to three years, presenting an opportunity for greater insight into the ways in which participating in BOOST as an undergraduate can influence their performance and experience in the workforce. As such, this study follows up on our prior BOOST evaluation, seeking to understand in what ways, if at all, the BOOST model impacted the workforce experience of its graduates, including (a) applying for, interviewing for, and/or landing jobs, including in their field of study; (b) providing work-based experience that was representative of the work they encountered in their jobs; (c) creating the conditions for graduates to experience promotions within their workplace; and (d) other impacts identified by graduates.

Graduates interviewed for this study consistently described BOOST as one of the most workplace-relevant elements of their degree. They reported that the open source projects mirrored the complexity of industry work, requiring them to collaborate, manage tasks, and adopt professional problem-solving approaches. Many highlighted that the capstone was the closest academic experience to “real-world” employment, giving them confidence to contribute quickly in their first jobs. Several noted the value of showcasing their open source projects on resumes and in interviews, with some securing jobs or promotions directly because of the skills and experiences gained.

Importantly, graduates credited BOOST with both technical proficiency and soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and project management, that set them apart from peers. Many felt the experience accelerated their career trajectory, with some reporting faster promotion rates than colleagues who lacked comparable real-world preparation. Overall, findings suggest BOOST effectively bridges the gap between classroom learning and professional practice, offering an equitable alternative to traditional internships that positions GRC graduates for long-term career success.

Partnering with a recruitment firm, we conducted a natural field experiment in which 70,000 applicants were randomly assigned to be interviewed by human recruiters, AI voice agents, or given a choice between the two. In all three conditions, human recruiters evaluated interviews and made hiring decisions based on applicants' performance in the interview and a standardized test. Contrary to the forecasts of professional recruiters, we find that AI-led interviews increase job offers by 12\%, job starts by 18\%, and 30-day retention by 17\% among all applicants. Applicants accept job offers with a similar likelihood and rate interview, as well as recruiter quality, similarly in a customer experience survey. When offered the choice, 78\% of applicants choose the AI recruiter, and we find evidence that applicants with lower test scores are more likely to choose AI. Analyzing interview transcripts reveals that AI-led interviews elicit more hiring-relevant information from applicants compared to human-led interviews. Recruiters score the interview performance of AI-interviewed applicants higher, but place greater weight on standardized tests in their hiring decisions. Overall, we provide evidence that AI can match human recruiters in conducting job interviews while preserving applicants' satisfaction and firm operations.},

It considers four key components of peer review in some depth: criteria, the review process, roles and responsibilities, and ethics and etiquette. To do so, it draws on relevant literature, guidance and forms associated with peer review, interviews with journal editors and conference chairs, and a limited survey of the computing education research community. In addition to providing an overview of practice, this report identifies a number of themes running through the discourse that have relevance for decision making about how best to conduct peer review for a given venue.},

	abstract = {Background and Context: Empirical researchers have a long-standing tradition of explicitly discussing the threats to and limitations of their research. In the past twenty years, these discussions emerged as a standard component of empirical research papers in computing education research (CER) as well. Objective: Our goal was to find out how the CER community talks about threats and limitations (which we refer to collectively as “challenges”) and how they “respond” to these challenges. Method: Our dataset included a total of 77 papers from four venues: two CER journals, Computer Science Education (CSEJ) and ACM Transactions of Computing Education (TOCE); one CER conference, ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER); and, for comparison, one mathematics-education journal, The Journal for Research in Mathematics Education (JRME). We analyzed the discussions of threats and limitations in these papers using deductive codes drawn from the literature, while also being open to new codes that emerged from the data. We took the papers on their own terms, so where qualitative and quantitative papers discuss challenges differently, we report on both. Findings: We found that the majority of these papers—65 out of 77—did discuss challenges. Depending on the research methodology employed, authors reported challenges that we could map to either internal and external validity, construct validity, and statistical conclusions or to trustworthiness criteria. Most of the challenges related to study design, but some related to study implementation, analysis, and interpretation of the results. Almost none of the challenges we found were unique to CER, but were also found in JRME. Our contributions include describing the broad range of challenges and responses that are discussed and connecting them to concrete circumstances in CER. Finally, we find that threats are seen both as important information about and as challenges to the study being reported. The tension between these two perspectives is resolved by including both, in patterns of challenge and response. Implications: Most immediately, we hope that this paper will broaden the perspective of those sitting down to write a threats and limitations section. It may also be of use at the study-design phase, since some of the challenges can be avoided with the benefit of hindsight. And finally, we hope to start a conversation about the challenges to our research: which can be mitigated, when (and how) a convincing argument can be made that an apparent challenge is not a problem, and which challenges might warrant serious revisions before submission (by the author) or rejection (by reviewers).},

Furthermore, germane cognitive load can be defined in terms of intrinsic cognitive load, thus also associating germane cognitive load with element interactivity.

	abstract = {A growing number of low- and middle-income country (LMIC) institutions have developed and implemented formal programs to support mentorship. Although the individual-level benefits of mentorship are well established, such activities can also sustainably build institutional capacity, bridge inequities in health care, and catalyze scientific advancement. To date, however, evaluation of these programs remains limited, representing an important gap in our understanding about the impact of mentoring. Without rigorous and ongoing evaluation, there may be missed opportunities for identifying best practices, iteratively improving program activities, and demonstrating the returns on investment in mentorship. In this report, we propose a framework for evaluating mentorship programs in LMIC settings where resources may be constrained. We identify six domains: 1) mentor–mentee relationship, 2) career guidance, 3) academic productivity, 4) networking, 5) wellness, and 6) organizational capacity. Within each, we describe specific metrics and how they may be considered as part of evaluation plans. We emphasize the role of measurement and evaluation at the institutional level, so that programs may enhance their mentoring capacity and optimize the management of their resources. Although we advocate for a comprehensive approach to evaluation, we recognize that—depending on stage and relative maturity—some domains may be prioritized to address short- and medium-term program goals.},

	abstract = {Hackathon-style coding events are a popular and promising approach to broadening participation in computer science and engineering. We present a quantitative analysis of self-reported perseverance in coding after hackathon-style events for 4,703 hackathon participants run by the nonprofit organization CodeDay. Drawing from previous work on broadening participation in computing, we test hypotheses that seek to answer three questions about whether and how hackathon-style coding events support continued engagement in computing among young people: (1) Are participants from underrepresented groups as likely to continue to engage in coding after attending a hackathon-style event? (2) Are participants more likely to continue to code after hackathon-style events if they attend events with demographically similar peers? (3) Are participants more likely to continue to code after a hackathon-style event if they present their work? In line with many studies of broadening participation, we find that members of underrepresented groups are less likely to report continuing to engage in programming 10 weeks after hackathon-style events. However, we find that these participants are more likely to report continuing to code when a larger proportion of attendees at their event share their gender or ethnicity. We also find that membership in underrepresented groups is associated with a greater likelihood of continued engagement when participants present their work to others at the end of events. Our work contributes to the literature on both education and broadening participation in computing by outlining several conditions under which hackathon-style events may be effective in promoting continued engagement among underrepresented young people.},

Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.},

This work defines engineering in terms of the students' course-related learning outcomes (e.g., skills and knowledge) described in the latest version of the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000). We argue that aligning students' perceptions of course task value with the EC2000 should enhance students' perceptions of the engineering profession and increase their interest in the field overall. Using student interviews from a larger study of instructor and student experiences in three undergraduate engineering programs, this study is guided by the following questions: 1) What are students' perceptions of the skills required by the engineering profession? 2) How do these perceptions compare to the skill set defined by ABET EC2000? 3) How do these perceptions affect students' assessment of course value and interest in the relevant coursework? Two required introductory engineering courses, Physics Laboratory and Engineering Design, are investigated. The ensuing theoretical framework is placed in the broader context of Eccles and Wigfield's expectancy-value model, specifically focusing on utility value. Our findings indicate that students' perceptions of the skills and knowledge required in professional engineering diverge from those defined by ABET. This disparity is negatively correlated to the students' assessment of the required coursework utility value. The absence of perceived utility then contributes to the students' lack of interest in their courses.},

We share the rubric we used to grade these updates, as well as how we trained an AI tool to perform this work for us.This tool was used by several hundred students from US-based Career and Technical Colleges (CTCs) and non-R1 universities, who were largely underrepresented in Computer Science. We found that collecting and publishing standups reduced the number of students who did not significantly contribute. We also found that scoring the standups according to a rubric helped identify and reach out to any students who were still not contributing, which helped some students but not others. Finally, we found that an AI tool can be used to evaluate student updates at scale helping under-resourced schools and over-worked faculty to implement this program in their classrooms.},

In an effort to understand how tools like Scratch and Blockly differ from more conventional text-based introductory programming languages with respect to conceptual understanding, we developed a set of "commutative" assessments. Each multiple-choice question on the assessment includes a short program that can be displayed in either a blocks- based or text-based form. The set of potential answers for each question includes the correct answer along with choices informed by prior research on novice programming misconceptions. In this paper we introduce the Commutative Assessment, discuss the theoretical and practical motivations for the assessment, and present findings from a study that used the assessment. The study had 90 high school students take the assessment at three points over the course of the first ten weeks of an introduction to programming course, alternating the modality (blocks vs. text) for each question over the course of the three administrations of the assessment. Our analysis reveals differences on performance between blocks-based and text-based questions as well as differences in the frequency of misconceptions based on the modality. Future work, potential implications, and limitations of these findings are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Novices face many barriers when learning to program a computer, including the need to learn both a new syntax and a model of computation. By constraining syntax and providing concrete visual representations on which to operate, direct manipulation programming environments can potentially lower these barriers. However, what if the ultimate learning goal of the novice is to be able to program in conventional textual languages, as is the case for introductory computer science students? Can direct manipulation programming environments lower the initial barriers to programming, and, at the same time, facilitate positive transfer to textual programming? To address this question, we designed a new direct manipulation programming interface for novices, and conducted an experimental study to compare the programming processes and outcomes promoted by the direct manipulation interface against those promoted by a textual programming interface. We found that the direct manipulation interface promoted significantly better initial programming outcomes, positive transfer to the textual interface, and significant differences in programming processes. Our results show that direct manipulation interfaces can provide novices with a “way in” to traditional textual programming.},

While some schools are content to use VBBLs to spark interest and motivation for the future pursuit of computing, others are asking, "Does this early exposure produce knowledge that transfers to traditional text-based languages (TBLs)?" If transfer is a goal, then a corollary is, "How do we design the transition to maximize the transfer?" This paper focuses on initialization of state and variables, exploring the differences between Scratch and two TBLs: C and Java. Based on observations of 9-12 year old students in a VBBL curriculum, we identify four "pieces of knowledge" that are critical for C and Java but are not nearly as obvious in Scratch, including whether, when, and how to perform initialization. We conclude with suggestions for instruction and development environment that may improve transfer.},

Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator and the ASCII table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs using common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.},

At the same time, most CS departments across the country are only seeing 25-30\% of female students in their classes, meaning that we are failing to draw interest from a large portion of the population. In this work, we explore the gender gap in CS at Rutgers University using three data sets that span thousands of students across 3.5 academic years. By combining these data sets, we can explore interesting issues such as retention, as students progress through the CS major. For example, we find that a large percentage of women taking the Introductory CS1 course for majors do not intend to major in CS, which contributes to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after CS1. This finding implies that a large part of the retention task is attracting these women to further explore the major. We correlate our findings with initiatives that some CS programs across the country have taken to significantly improve their gender diversity, and identify initiatives that we can start with in our effort to increase the diversity in our program. These findings may also be applicable to the computing programs at other large public research universities.},

To combat this trend, our department has made a concerted effort to revamp our introductory course sequence to both attract and retain more women and minority students. The focus of this paper is the changes instituted in our Introduction to Computer Science course (i.e., CS1) intended for both majors and non-majors. In addition to changing the content of the course, we introduced a new student mentoring program that is managed by a full-time coordinator and consists of undergraduate students who have recently completed the course. This paper describes these efforts in detail, including the extension of these changes to our CS2 course and the associated costs required to maintain these efforts. We measure the impact of these changes by tracking student enrollment and performance over 13 academic years. We show that, unlike national trends, enrollment from underrepresented groups has increased dramatically over this time period. Additionally, we show that the student mentoring program has increased both performance and retention of students, particularly from underrepresented groups, at statistically significant levels.},

The authors develop the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people are more similar within than between organizations, interactions involving people transfer more readily within than between firms. By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage in firms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The importance of internships has grown during the last decade. Internships have a lot of benefits for both, the company and the intern as well. In order to get most out of an internship, it is important that knowledge, which is related to the job assignments, is efficiently transferred to the interns. The purpose of this study is to explore the processes of knowledge transfer to the interns based on Nonoka and Takeuchi's knowledge creation model with a focus on tacit to explicit knowledge transfer.

The transfer of the required knowledge is twofold: firstly, interns must have access to already existing documents (rather explicit knowledge). Secondly, interns acquire knowledge through permanent transfer of knowledge from those who are highly experienced, like principals or workmates (rather tacit knowledge). This study used a qualitative approach to collect and analyze empirical data whereas two sources were used. In a first phase of the empirical survey a diary study with nine participants was carried out. In a following second phase semi-structured interviews with another 20 participants were conducted. The study represents the perspective of business informatics students who have to complete an internship as part of their studies.

Participants state that the best experience of their internship is based on a combination of personal support, self-reliant working and the opportunity to have access to content or knowledge management systems. An intensive training phase conducted by co-workers or previous interns is perceived positively in gaining relevant knowledge for their internship. From a qualitative perspective the support of people was ranked on the first place. The technological aspects such as knowledge management tools actively support the process of knowledge sharing.},

The long-term goal of these projects is to attract more underrepresented students to computing careers by increasing their self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that one can succeed in a particular task or field. Thanks to generous support from Google, RU and SRU have been offered at several other colleges and universities as well. This paper summarizes the results from spring 2013 to summer 2016, reports on an alumni survey answered by 68 (32\%) of the 211 alumni, and includes excerpts from five semi-structured interviews. The majority (63\%) of the alumni survey respondents, who are in college, are majoring in computing. A similar percentage of the alumni who are still in high school intend to major in computing (62\%). When asked about the programs' impact on their career choices and interest in computing, 61\% of respondents indicated that the program increased their interest in computer science and 24\% indicated that it changed their career plans to computing.},

Applying a systematic approach to collecting papers presented at the Symposium that focus on novice programming / CS1, we categorized hundreds of papers according to their main focus, revealing important introductory programming topics and their trends from 1970 to 2018. Some of these topics have faded from prominence and are less relevant today while others, including many topics focused on students, such as making learning programming more appropriate from gender, diversity, accessibility and inclusion standpoints, have garnered significant attention more recently. We present discussions on these trends and in doing so, we provide a checkpoint for introductory programming research.

This paper presents findings from our multi-institutional study aimed at understanding the participation of CS students in industry internships as well as analyzing the differences between students who intern and those who do not. We surveyed 536 CS undergraduate students across three universities in the United States and analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. We used thematic analysis on the open-ended survey responses. Overall, we found that 40\% of students participate in at least one internship. Demographically, equal proportions of males and females interned. However, we observed that students who have higher socioeconomic status were more likely to intern. Academically, there were no significant differences between students who intern and those who do not. However, through thematic analysis, we found differences regarding students’ preparation process. Interns explicitly prepared to secure internship positions by practicing interview questions and dedicating time to career preparation. Students who do not intern were less involved in the application process or relied on coursework for securing internships. Quantitative results from the survey corroborated our qualitative findings that factors outside of coursework are influencing students’ ability to secure industry internships.},

Students benefit from industry sponsorship of senior design projects through the opportunity to work on realworld problems of importance to industry, exposure to industry and company-specific project management and product development processes, and familiarity with economic, legal, and regulatory design constraints. This paper provides a brief description of the Multidisciplinary Capstone Design course at Marquette University, examples of industry involvement in the course, and the observed benefits of industry involvement to students, the university, and industry participants. It presents examples of current practices used at other schools as well as helpful recommendations for managing industry participation in capstone design courses.},

	abstract = {Work-integrated learning is a common approach to add practical, real-world work experience to academic settings. Traditional coop programs in colleges and universities alternate courses with semesters spent as an intern at a relevant workplace. We have designed an academic-industry partnership that takes work-integrated learning further by deliberately aligning workplace experience to the academic curriculum. Our students earn a Bachelor of Computer Science from the university, and are paid employees of the industry partner throughout their degree. While advanced courses and electives are taken on campus as usual, some core computer science classes and practicum courses are delivered with the industry partner so as to integrate them with placements on site. Assessment remains the responsibility of the university. In this report, we describe the partnership from the perspective of the industry partner. We describe our goals, partnership design, and first two iterations of the implementation. We discuss the challenges we have faced with our first cohort, and share suggestions for others looking to create similar programs.},

	abstract = {Producing sufficient numbers of graduates who are prepared for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations has become a national priority in the United States. To attain this goal, some policymakers have targeted reducing STEM attrition in college, arguing that retaining more students in STEM fields in college is a low-cost, fast way to produce   the STEM professionals that the nation needs (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology [PCAST] 2012). Within this context, this Statistical Analysis Report (SAR) presents an examination ofstudents’ attrition from STEM fields over the course of 6 years in college using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). In this SAR, the term STEM attrition refers to enrollment choices that result in potential STEM graduates (i.e., undergraduates who declare a STEM major) moving away from STEM fields by switching majors to non-STEM fields or leaving postsecondary education before earning a degree or certificate.1 The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of this attrition by: •determining rates of attrition from STEM and non-STEM fields; •identifying characteristics of students who leave STEM fields;•comparing the STEM coursetaking and performance of STEM leavers and persisters; and•examining the strength of various factors’ associations with STEM attrition.Data from a cohort of students who started their postsecondary education in a bachelor’s or associate’s degree program in the 2003−04 academic year were used to examine students’ movement into and out of STEM fields over the subsequent6 years through 2009. Analyses were performed separately for beginning bachelor’s and associate’s degree students. For brevity, these two groups are frequently referred to as bachelor’s or associate’s degree students in this study. Selected findings from this SAR are described below.},

This report is a  response to economic forecasting that suggested a need to produce over 1 million new STEM graduates over the next decade in order for the US to continue to compete in a technology-based global economy. PCAST (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology)  assembled a Working Group of experts in postsecondary STEM teaching, learning­ science research, curriculum development, higher­ education administration, faculty training, educational technology, and postsecondary STEM education.  . The report highlights challenges and barriers to retention and persistence that include a lack of knowledge of evidence-based teaching by faculty, and a lack of facilitation and reward for good teaching.

PCAST identified five overarching recommendations: (1) catalyze widespread adoption of empirically validated teaching practices; (2) advocate and provide support for replacing standard laboratory courses with discovery ­based research courses; (3) launch a national experiment in postsecondary mathematics education to address the mathematics­ preparation gap; (4) encourage partnerships among stakeholders to diversify pathways to STEM careers; and (5) create a Presidential Council on STEM Education with leadership from the academic and business communities to provide strategic leadership for transformative and sustainable change in STEM undergraduate education.},

The issues addressed concern the psychological mechanisms through which personal agency is exercised, the hierarchical structure of self-regulatory systems, eschewal of the dichotomous construal of self as agent and self as object, and the properties of a nondualistic but nonreductional conception of human agency. The relation of agent causality to the fundamental issues of freedom and determinism is also analyzed.},

	abstract = {Enrollment at America’s community colleges has exploded in recent years, with five times as many entering students today as in 1965. However, most community college students do not graduate; many earn no credits and may leave school with no more advantages in the labor market than if they had never attended. Experts disagree over the reason for community colleges’ mixed record. Is it that the students in these schools are under-prepared and ill-equipped for the academic rigors of college? Are the colleges themselves not adapting to keep up with the needs of the new kinds of students they are enrolling? In After Admission, James Rosenbaum, Regina Deil-Amen, and Ann Person weigh in on this debate with a close look at this important trend in American higher education. After Admission compares community colleges with private occupational colleges that offer accredited associates degrees. The authors examine how these different types of institutions reach out to students, teach them social and cultural skills valued in the labor market, and encourage them to complete a degree. Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, and Person find that community colleges are suffering from a kind of identity crisis as they face the inherent complexities of guiding their students towards four-year colleges or to providing them with vocational skills to support a move directly into the labor market. This confusion creates administrative difficulties and problems allocating resources. However, these contradictions do not have to pose problems for students. After Admission shows that when colleges present students with clear pathways, students can effectively navigate the system in a way that fits their needs. The occupational colleges the authors studied employed close monitoring of student progress, regular meetings with advisors and peer cohorts, and structured plans for helping students meet career goals in a timely fashion. These procedures helped keep students on track and, the authors suggest, could have the same effect if implemented at community colleges. As college access grows in America, institutions must adapt to meet the needs of a new generation of students. After Admission highlights organizational innovations that can help guide students more effectively through higher education.},

The data showed that, contrary to expectations, increases in teacher effectiveness yielded greater savings than the reduction in costs associ-ated with teacher attrition. Overall, the benefit-cost analysis showed that, after 5 years, an investment of \$1 produces a positive return to society, the school district, the teachers, and the students, and the state almost recovers its expenses. Implications are drawn for both education and public policy.},

	doi = {10.7916/D8B283C1},
	abstract = {While promoting postsecondary credential completion is a national priority intended to help graduates secure good jobs, the value of credentials in the labor market from the perspective of employers is not well understood. Specifically, more attention is needed to understand how credentials align with employer needs. Through in-depth interviews with managers responsible for hiring information technology technicians, we examined their perceptions of associate and bachelor’s degree holders in two contrasting labor markets: Detroit and Seattle. The study led to several key findings. First, across the two labor markets, employers expected some common qualities in both associate and bachelor’s degree holders, including technical skills and knowledge, thinking skills, communication skills, and discipline. Second, while they expected some positive qualities in associate degree holders that were distinctive to this credential, many hiring managers also expected negative characteristics, such as a lack of academic ability, initiative, or skill. However, while both associate and bachelor’s degrees provided relevant information about potential workers, employers did not expect the credentials to provide information about certain key qualities they sought in workers, including competency in customer service and teamwork, and personal interest in technology. Some of the qualities that employers expected in associate degree holders were linked to their local labor markets and their perceptions of the local community colleges. This study provides suggestions on how an understanding of the specific qualities employers expect in credential holders and of the role of the local labor market can help colleges better engage with employers and fine-tune their programs to more effectively meet students’ and employer’s needs.},

In a workforce approach, curriculum is driven by the needs of local industry, course delivery systems are sufficiently flexible to meet the diverse needs of students and industry, and students experience a mixture of work-based and classroom learning. These features combine to help students succeed at a postsecondary education and gain important training with less than a four-year degree.
This paper describes how community colleges came to be a major resource for the nation’s workforce development requirements and discusses the ways this role continues to evolve to meet the needs of students, employers, and local communities.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the mission of the market-responsive community college. These colleges include mid- and high-level workforce training in their curriculum. Some of the characteristics of a market-responsive community college detailed here include: (1) allocating resources to develop training programs; (2) reaching out to businesses and other organizations; (3) responding rapidly to changes in local economic conditions and training needs; (4) recruiting faculty from among local experts in the field; and (5) partnering with other local educational institutions to deliver comprehensive training. Over 200 publications were reviewed for this report, and the 25 articles that contained the most relevant information, including descriptions of labor-market responsive behavior, were selected. The four methodologies used in preparing the articles that were selected were: (1) statistical analysis; (2) less formal data analysis; (3) literature reviews; and (4) anecdotal evidence. The conclusions of this review will be used as hypotheses to be thoroughly tested in the next phase of this initiative. A reading of the literature found that outsourced training expenditures for U.S. companies nearly doubled, from \$9.9 billion to \$19.3 billion annually, between 1994 and 2000. Includes brief outlines of specific community college programs and 25 annotated references to literature analyzed for the study. (NB)},

We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of I972 which includes postsecondary transcript data and the NLS Y to study the distinct returns to 2-year and 4-year college attendance and degree completion. Controlling for family income and measured ability, wage differentials for both 2-year and 4-year college credits are positive and similar. We find that the average 2-year and 4-year college student earned roughly 5\% more than similar high school graduates for every year of credits completed. Second, average bachelor and associate degree recipients did not earn significantly more than those with similar numbers of college credits and no degree, suggesting that the credentialling effects of these degree are small. We report similar results from the NLSY and the CPS. In addition to controlling for family background and ability measures, we pursue two IV strategies to identify measurement error and selection bias. First, we use self-reported education as an instrument for transcript reported education. Second, we use public tuition and distance from the closest 2-year and 4-year colleges as instruments, which we take as orthogonal to schooling measurement error and other unobserved characteristics of college students. Although research over the past decade has been preoccupied with selection bias, the two biases roughly cancel each other, suggesting that the results above are, if anything, understated.},

	abstract = {Studies show that high-tenure displaced workers typically incur substantial long-term earnings losses. As these losses have become increasingly apparent, policy makers have significantly expanded resources for retraining, much of which takes place in regular community college classes. To analyze the effectiveness of such training, we link administrative earnings records with the community college transcript records of workers displaced from jobs during the first half of the 1990s in Washington State. We explore several issues of statistical specification for regression models quantifying the impact of community college credits on earnings. These include (i) the need to allow for a transition period immediately after the end of workers’ schooling when their earnings may be temporarily depressed, (ii) whether earnings gains are strictly proportional to credits earned, and (iii) how to model worker-specific unobserved heterogeneity. In our preferred specification, we find that the equivalent of an academic year of community college schooling raises the long-term earnings of displaced workers by an average of about 9 percent for men and about 13 percent for women. However, these average returns mask substantial variation in the returns associated with different types of courses. On the one hand, we estimate that an academic year of more technically oriented vocational and academic math and science courses raise earnings by about 14 percent for men and 29 percent for women. On the other hand, we estimate that less technically oriented courses yield very low and possibly zero returns. About one third of the increase in earnings associated with more technically oriented vocational and academic math and science courses is estimated to be due to increases in wage rates, with the remainder attributable to increased hours of work.},

However, too few American students, especially women, pursue these fields. Although this problem has attracted enormous attention, rigorously tested interventions outside artificial laboratory settings are quite rare. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment investigating the effect of peer mentoring on women’s experiences and retention in engineering during college transition, assessing its impact for 1 y while mentoring was active, and an additional 1 y after mentoring had ended. Incoming women engineering students (
              n
              = 150) were randomly assigned to female or male peer mentors or no mentors for 1 y. Their experiences were assessed multiple times during the intervention year and 1-y postintervention. Female (but not male) mentors protected women’s belonging in engineering, self-efficacy, motivation, retention in engineering majors, and postcollege engineering aspirations. Counter to common assumptions, better engineering grades were not associated with more retention or career aspirations in engineering in the first year of college. Notably, increased belonging and self-efficacy were significantly associated with more retention and career aspirations. The benefits of peer mentoring endured long after the intervention had ended, inoculating women for the first 2 y of college—the window of greatest attrition from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Thus, same-gender peer mentoring for a short period during developmental transition points promotes women’s success and retention in engineering, yielding dividends over time.},

As a case study, we analyzed Google Summer of Code (GSoC), which is a three-month program that fosters students' participation in OSS projects. We found that 82\% of the studied OSS projects merged at least one students' commit in codebase. When only newcomers are considered, {\textasciitilde}54\% of OSS projects merged at least one commit. We also found that {\textasciitilde}23\% of newcomers started contributing to GSoC projects before knowing they would be accepted. We also did not find statistical difference between newcomers and students with prior participation in the projects regarding retention time after GSoC, except for 2015 edition. Using survival analysis, we found that {\textasciitilde}40\% of students kept contributing longer than a month, while {\textasciitilde}15\% contributed longer than a year. OSS communities can take advantage of our results to balance the trade-offs involved in joining this kind of program and to set expectations about how much contribution to expect and for how long students engage.},

Opportunities for such internships occur rarely, however, for many rural two-year colleges, especially those geographically isolated from companies which could provide this experience. Despite such a situation at our college, we still provide students with an internship experience by creating an internal organization: the Software Development Internship (SDI) with the mission to develop custom software for other departments on campus.

However, little is empirically known about the impact industry-based internships have on CS students' career paths as well as the effectiveness of CS degree programs in preparing students for these professional development opportunities. In this paper, we present a thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses of 40 CS undergraduate students in the US who participated in an internship. This study aimed to understand the impact that professional internships have on: CS students' career goals, students' perceptions of the gaps between academia and industry, and students' strategies for professional success. We found four themes that describe the impact of internships on CS students. Internships (1) strengthened students' commitment to CS degrees and careers; (2) encouraged exploration of CS careers and industries; (3) promoted personal/professional growth; and (4) developed awareness of professional expectations. We also analyzed students' perception of the curriculum's effectiveness and found that students were strategically working to improve their technical skills outside of coursework to secure employment. These findings have the potential to retain students in computing and reduce the gaps between academia and industry, thereby increasing CS students' competitiveness in the workforce.},

SCCT focuses on students' prior experience, social support, self-efficacy and outcome expectation. The research is partly motivated by the desire to increase female participation rates in CS, particularly in the UK. Policymakers can use the factors that both females and males identify as influencing their choice of studying CS to enhance the experiences of all students prior to coming to university, but female students in particular. The study uses a semi-structured interview with 17 mixed gender subjects currently studying CS at three Scottish universities. The findings are that social support from family, teachers, friends and mentors is a particularly important factor in choosing to study CS, especially for female subjects. The career paths offered by a CS degree is another major factor, not just the potential jobs, but also the general value of a CS education and the potential to make useful contributions to society. School education appeared to have limited influence, though exposure to problem solving, programming, online self-learning and internships are positive influences. The stereotypical view of CS students as 'geeks' is outdated and unhelpful - it is more appropriate to see them as 'analytical' or 'over-achievers'. Subjects make many suggestions for improving the CS education provided at school, especially to make it more attractive to females, including: make it compulsory, teach it earlier, include more programming and problem solving, and increase the visibility of female exemplars and role models.},

For a variety of reasons, including the genuine desire to meet the needs of its graduates, geography is responding to the employability agenda through curriculum change and innovation. However, it is important that any employment‐related developments and initiatives are informed by the opinions and experiences of present and former students. This paper addresses this need by comparing the undergraduate career expectations and post‐graduation career experiences of geography students from the University of Plymouth. The study allows comparisons to be made between two cohorts and reveals which aspects of their degree the graduate cohort found to be most and least useful in their current employment.},

Understanding these views could shed light on why the academia-industry gap has persisted despite the attention.

In order to identify a spectrum of faculty views, we interviewed 14 faculty from a variety of backgrounds across three institutions.

Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment.

Retrospective protocols yielded substantial forgetting or fabrication in all tasks, supporting the consensus on the nonveridicality of these methods.

Based on the analysis, we propose a framework for understanding these strategies and suggest how task resumption might be better supported in future development tools. The results suggest that task resumption is a frequent and persistent problem for developers. For example, we find that only 10\% of the sessions have programming activity resume in less than 1 min after an interruption, only 7\% of the programming sessions involve no navigation to other locations prior to editing. We also found that programmers use multiple coping mechanisms to recover task context when resuming work.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the interface between work stress and nonwork stress and how it relates to health. Results indicate that the way people feel at work is largely a function of conditions at work. Similarly, the way people feel outside of work is largely a function of things that occur outside the job. Both work and nonwork stress are independently associated with physical and mental health, although the relationship between nonwork stress and health is slightly stronger. Excessive demands or stresses in one domain can interfere with life in the other. Such conflict operates equally in both directions. When present it can be an added source of stress and adversely affect health. Taken together these findings suggest that the stress people experience at work is not simply a reflection of their "personal problems." This has implications for the design of health promotion and stress prevention programs in the workplace.},

	abstract = {Problem-solving on a whiteboard is a popular technical interview technique used in industry. However, several critics have raised concerns that whiteboard interviews can cause excessive stress and cognitive load on candidates, ultimately reinforcing bias in hiring practices. Unfortunately, many sensors used for measuring cognitive state are not robust to movement. In this paper, we describe an approach where we use a head-mounted eye-tracker and computer vision algorithms to collect robust metrics of cognitive state. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we study two proposed interview settings: on the whiteboard and on paper with 11 participants. Our preliminary results suggest that the whiteboard setting pressures candidates into keeping shorter attention lengths and experiencing higher levels of cognitive load compared to solving the same problems on paper. For instance, we observed 60ms shorter fixation durations and 3x more regressions when solving problems on the whiteboard. Finally, we describe a vision for creating a more inclusive technical interview process through future studies of interventions that lower cognitive load and stress.},

Although there have been a number of studies on student attitudes toward learning within HFOSS projects, little has been documented about instructors' experiences supporting their students in the classroom. This paper examines survey results from 26 faculty members who participated in an NSF-funded Professors' Open Source Software Experience workshop with the goal of incorporating HFOSS into their curriculum. The survey was designed to identify barriers to using HFOSS in the classroom, to understand the type of classes where instructors incorporated HFOSS, the successes attained and challenges faced by instructors, and to understand instructors' future plans. The data gathered was used to enhance semi-structured interviews that are currently being analyzed. This paper focuses on the hurdles reported by faculty members, the cross-section of uses of HFOSS in the classroom as well as factors that may influence one's ability to integrate HFOSS into the curriculum. The results of the survey demonstrate that faculty have successfully incorporated HFOSS into a wide range of courses across all four years of the curriculum with both large and small classes. The major hurdles are time to prepare materials for one's course as well as finding time within an existing course to integrate HFOSS material.},

We conducted an in-class study that controlled for both time-on-task and selection bias to investigate the potential benefits of integrating these interventions into the existing footprint of an introductory computing course. Despite the previously reported promise of the interventions we implemented, our findings were that in this context these techniques had only a mild positive effect for some students. We discuss possible reasons why these techniques are less successful than instructors might hope and argue for the need for more research on this topic.},

The objective is to determine if faculty development in growth mindset and active use of the growth mindset cues in the CS0 and CS1 classroom result in superior academic outcomes. Comparative study results are presented for two semesters of virtual classroom environments: one semester without Growth Mindset, and one semester with Growth Mindset. Female students demonstrated the most growth, as measured by academic grades, in CS0, and maintained that growth in CS1. Males demonstrated growth as well, with both males and females converging at the same high point of accomplishment at the end of CS1.

However, little is known about the effects of enrollment policies on students' experiences. To identify relationships between those policies and students' experiences, we linked survey data from 1245 first-year students in 80 CS departments to a dataset of department policies. We found that competitive enrollment negatively predicts first-year students' perception of the computing department as welcoming, their sense of belonging, and their self-efficacy in computing. Both belonging and self-efficacy are known predictors of student retention in CS. In addition, these relationships are stronger for students without pre-college computing experience. Our classification of institutions as competitive is conservative, and false positives are likely. This biases our results and suggests that the negative relationships we found are an underestimation of the effects of competitive enrollment.},

This is counter to research indicating that code comprehension is an important developmental step for novice programmers. We observed this in our own CS-0 introductory programming course, and furthermore, that students weren’t making the connection between code comprehension in labs and a final examination that required solutions to pencil-and-paper comprehension and writing exercises, where sound understanding of programming concepts is essential. Realising these deficiencies late in our course, we put on three 3-hour optional revision evenings just days before the exam. Based on a mastery learning philosophy, students were expected to work through a bank of around 200 pencil-and-paper exercises. By comparison with a machine-based hackathon, we called this a Thinkathon. Students completed a pre and post questionnaire about their experience of the Thinkathon. While we find that Thinkathon attendance positively influences final grades, we believe our reflection on the overall experience is of greater value. We report that: respected methods for developing code comprehension may not be enough on their own; novices must exercise their developing skills away from machines; and there are social learning outcomes in programming courses, currently implicit, that we should make explicit.},

This paper analyzes data from five years of a two-semester capstone experience in which students consider a number of FOSS and/or HFOSS projects and choose one to engage with. Findings support assertions that projects with humanitarian goals are preferred by both women and students with lower confidence in their software development and teamwork skills. The data analysis is suggestive that African American, Black and Hispanic (ABH) students may also show preferences for projects with humanitarian goals. An exploratory analysis of pre-course survey data adds additional insight into how gender, race/ethnicity, student confidence and perceptions of community may influence project selection, helping to identify important directions for further investigation.

Both males and females thrived academically when they had excellent instructors using good pedagogical practices. However, several predictors of CS grades were gender-specific. Female majors with positive stereotypes about CS students, who had had female computer teachers in middle school, felt interconnected with others, felt that peers are not cliquish, and perceived that faculty treat female students equitably had higher CS grades than female majors who scored lower on these variables. Overall, female majors' grades could be predicted more accurately than males' grades. Interestingly, previous computer experience was not related to CS grades. This knowledge can be harnessed to provide an optimal environment for all students, especially females, to enhance their CS course performance, and ultimately to increase retention in the major.},

During its short lifetime, the Project has inspired increasing numbers of students and instructors to make significant contributions to several humanitarian open source software development projects.

In the last four years, the HFOSS Project has received material support from several partners, including the National Science Foundation, Accenture, Google, and Mozilla. This support has enabled the Project to expand its reach to add new college and university partners and to add more humanitarian software projects.  

Contributions to the HFOSS Project come from professionals in academia, IT organizations, and non-profit organizations that engage undergraduate students in courses, research projects, and summer internship experiences. Its curriculum is accessible to a wide range of undergraduates, since it includes courses for non- majors as well as computer science and engineering majors.

This paper describes all these activities and their impact on undergraduate computing education, local non-profit organizations, and global FOSS communities. It concludes by identifying the progress that the HFOSS Project has made toward developing a sustainable infrastructure.},

	abstract = {The gap between the software industry and software engineering education was first mentioned three decades ago, in 1989. Since then, its existence has been regularly reported on and solutions to close it have been proposed. However, after thirty years this gap resists all efforts for closure. In this study we assert that the gap between industry and academia exists for several reasons that are related and intertwined. To take a broader look at the problem from the perspective of all related entities, we (i) provide a detailed overview of the profession and identify the entities, (ii) extract the causes that stem from these entities and discuss what each entity should do, (iii) report and analyze the results of a questionnaire that has been conducted with students and recent graduates, (iv) emphasize the highlights of the interviews conducted with students, recent graduates and academics, (v) and compile a list of skills that are sought by the industry by analyzing the software engineering job advertisements. We further contribute to finding solutions by considering all entities involved, which provides an opportunity to access all of them, so that each can find out what they can do to acknowledge and narrow the gap. Our study concludes that the gap requires constant attention and hard work for all of the entities involved, and therefore all should be on the lookout for new technologies, learn to embrace the changes and adapt to them, so that the gap is kept at a minimum.},

Employment in this sector is projected to grow 12\% between 2018 and 2028, which is faster than the average of all other occupations. Published data are available on traditional non-computer science-specific hiring processes. However, the hiring process for CS majors may be different. It is critical to have up-to-date information on questions such as “what positions are in high demand for CS majors?,” “what is a typical hiring process?,” and “what do employers say they look for when hiring CS graduates?” This article discusses the analysis of a survey of 218 recruiters hiring CS graduates in the United States. We used Atlas.ti to analyze qualitative survey data and report the results on what positions are in the highest demand, the hiring process, and the resume review process. Our study revealed that a software developer was the most common job the recruiters were looking to fill. We found that the hiring process steps for CS graduates are generally aligned with traditional hiring steps, with an additional emphasis on technical and coding tests. Recruiters reported that their hiring choices were based on reviewing resume’s experience, GPA, and projects sections. The results provide insights into the hiring process, decision making, resume analysis, and some discrepancies between current undergraduate CS program outcomes and employers’ expectations.},

	url = {https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10195607-engaging-stem-transformational-experiences-early-momentum-esteem},
	abstract = {Need/Motivation (e.g., goals, gaps in knowledge) The ESTEEM implemented a STEM building capacity project through students’ early access to a sustainable and innovative STEM Stepping Stones, called Micro-Internships (MI). The goal is to reap key benefits of a full-length internship and undergraduate research experiences in an abbreviated format, including access, success, degree completion, transfer, and recruiting and retaining more Latinx and underrepresented students into the STEM workforce. The MIs are designed with the goals to provide opportunities for students at a community college and HSI, with authentic STEM research and applied learning experiences (ALE), support for appropriate STEM pathway/career, preparation and confidence to succeed in STEM and engage in summer long REUs, and with improved outcomes. The MI projects are accessible early to more students and build momentum to better overcome critical obstacles to success. The MIs are shorter, flexibly scheduled throughout the year, easily accessible, and participation in multiple MI is encouraged. ESTEEM also establishes a sustainable and collaborative model, working with partners from BSCS Science Education, for MI’s mentor, training, compliance, and building capacity, with shared values and practices to maximize the improvement of student outcomes. New Knowledge (e.g., hypothesis, research questions) Research indicates that REU/internship experiences can be particularly powerful for students from Latinx and underrepresented groups in STEM. However, those experiences are difficult to access for many HSI-community college students (85\% of our students hold off-campus jobs), and lack of confidence is a barrier for a majority of our students. The gap between those who can and those who cannot is the “internship access gap.” This project is at a central California Community College (CCC) and HSI, the only affordable post-secondary option in a region serving a historically underrepresented population in STEM, including 75\% Hispanic, and 87\% have not completed college. MI is designed to reduce inequalities inherent in the internship paradigm by providing access to professional and research skills for those underserved students. The MI has been designed to reduce barriers by offering: shorter duration (25 contact hours); flexible timing (one week to once a week over many weeks); open access/large group; and proximal location (on-campus). MI mentors participate in week-long summer workshops and ongoing monthly community of practice with the goal of co-constructing a shared vision, engaging in conversations about pedagogy and learning, and sustaining the MI program going forward. Approach (e.g., objectives/specific aims, research methodologies, and analysis) Research Question and Methodology: We want to know: How does participation in a micro-internship affect students’ interest and confidence to pursue STEM? We used a mixed-methods design triangulating quantitative Likert-style survey data with interpretive coding of open-responses to reveal themes in students’ motivations, attitudes toward STEM, and confidence. Participants: The study sampled students enrolled either part-time or full-time at the community college. Although each MI was classified within STEM, they were open to any interested student in any major. Demographically, participants self-identified as 70\% Hispanic/Latinx, 13\% Mixed-Race, and 42 female. Instrument: Student surveys were developed from two previously validated instruments that examine the impact of the MI intervention on student interest in STEM careers and pursuing internships/REUs. Also, the pre- and post (every e months to assess longitudinal outcomes) -surveys included relevant open response prompts. The surveys collected students’ demographics; interest, confidence, and motivation in pursuing a career in STEM; perceived obstacles; and past experiences with internships and MIs. 171 students responded to the pre-survey at the time of submission. Outcomes (e.g., preliminary findings, accomplishments to date) Because we just finished year 1, we lack at this time longitudinal data to reveal if student confidence is maintained over time and whether or not students are more likely to (i) enroll in more internships, (ii) transfer to a four-year university, or (iii) shorten the time it takes for degree attainment. For short term outcomes, students significantly Increased their confidence to continue pursuing opportunities to develop within the STEM pipeline, including full-length internships, completing STEM degrees, and applying for jobs in STEM. For example, using a 2-tailed t-test we compared means before and after the MI experience. 15 out of 16 questions that showed improvement in scores were related to student confidence to pursue STEM or perceived enjoyment of a STEM career. Finding from the free-response questions, showed that the majority of students reported enrolling in the MI to gain knowledge and experience. After the MI, 66\% of students reported having gained valuable knowledge and experience, and 35\% of students spoke about gaining confidence and/or momentum to pursue STEM as a career. Broader Impacts (e.g., the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM; development of a diverse STEM workforce, enhanced infrastructure for research and education) The ESTEEM project has the potential for a transformational impact on STEM undergraduate education’s access and success for underrepresented and Latinx community college students, as well as for STEM capacity building at Hartnell College, a CCC and HSI, for students, faculty, professionals, and processes that foster research in STEM and education. Through sharing and transfer abilities of the ESTEEM model to similar institutions, the project has the potential to change the way students are served at an early and critical stage of their higher education experience at CCC, where one in every five community college student in the nation attends a CCC, over 67\% of CCC students identify themselves with ethnic backgrounds that are not White, and 40 to 50\% of University of California and California State University graduates in STEM started at a CCC, thus making it a key leverage point for recruiting and retaining a more diverse STEM workforce.},

The recommendations are based on recent and on-going research into the gender gap in computer science and related disciplines They are intended to work in tandem with the Computing Research Association's recommendations for graduate programs (see [18] in this issue) to promote a general increase in women's participation in computing professions.Most of the suggestions offered here could improve the educational environment for both male and female students. However, general improvements are likely to be of particular benefit to women because women in our society do not generally receive the same level of support that men receive for entering and persisting in this field. Parents, friends, and classmates seldom encourage women to choose and continue in a computing discipline. Those few women who declare a computing major tend to experience continued lack of support throughout their education. They have few female peers to call on for help. Furthermore, students in their own and other majors may consider them odd. Even faculty can discourage women with unthinking remarks or with expectations based on the assumption that men's behavior and experience are the basis for success in computing majors. This lack of support can block or weaken women's commitment to computing. Moreover, when conditions in a department are generally unfavorable, those with a weakened commitment to the discipline often leave at higher rates than those who have sufficient support to overcome the conditions.},

In this paper, we present a systemic mentoring model that helps computer science students, in particular those at the early stage of their study, more effectively learn concepts, write better programs, and conduct quality projects. The model takes advantage of faculty mentors and undergraduate and graduate peer-mentors to establish early contacts with mentees and to maintain systemic mentoring through which both the mentee and peer-mentor will learn. The mentoring relationship between mentors and mentees is established early in the semester and will continue for as long as the need for such a relationship exists. A unique feature of this model is that the mentee-mentor role might be switched depending on the problem or concepts at hand.},

Cultural orientation also moderates the effectiveness of mentorship behaviors. In this study of 191 Hispanic undergraduates, protégé power distance orientation predicted desiring the mentor to act as a role model and moderated the effects of the mentor acting as a role model. Collectivism predicted wanting psychosocial support from mentors and collectivists also benefited more from psychosocial support.

Results focused on direct, mediating and moderating effects of mentoring on levels of wellbeing, integration and retention. Peer mentored individuals showed higher levels of integration to university. Four times as many non-peer mentored students had seriously considered leaving university compared to peer mentored students. Integration partially mediated the relationship between mentoring and intention to stay at university. Moderating effects analyses indicate that mentoring may buffer the effect of the transition to University.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore the mentor-mentee relationship with a focus on determining the characteristics of effective mentors and mentees and understanding the factors influencing successful and failed mentoring relationships.
METHOD: The authors completed a qualitative study through the Departments of Medicine at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine between March 2010 and January 2011. They conducted individual, semistructured interviews with faculty members from different career streams and ranks and analyzed transcripts of the interviews, drawing on grounded theory.
RESULTS: The authors completed interviews with 54 faculty members and identified a number of themes, including the characteristics of effective mentors and mentees, actions of effective mentors, characteristics of successful and failed mentoring relationships, and tactics for successful mentoring relationships. Successful mentoring relationships were characterized by reciprocity, mutual respect, clear expectations, personal connection, and shared values. Failed mentoring relationships were characterized by poor communication, lack of commitment, personality differences, perceived (or real) competition, conflicts of interest, and the mentor's lack of experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful mentorship is vital to career success and satisfaction for both mentors and mentees. Yet challenges continue to inhibit faculty members from receiving effective mentorship. Given the importance of mentorship on faculty members' careers, future studies must address the association between a failed mentoring relationship and a faculty member's career success, how to assess different approaches to mediating failed mentoring relationships, and how to evaluate strategies for effective mentorship throughout a faculty member's career.},

The ementoring program was part of a career portfolio prepared in sections of AGRI 1201, Agriculture and Human Sciences as a Profession, that were major specific for animal science majors. Impact of the experience on students was evaluated with pre- and post-mentoring questionnaires using Likert-scale (1–5, 1 = disagree or low level), selection (check those that apply), and open-ended questions. Pre-mentoring questionnaires (n = 128, 2002-2005) showed a willingness to participate in the ementoring program; however, students were reluctant to relocate for career reasons. Results revealed naivete about careers, limited career awareness and work experience. A total of 79 post-mentoring questionnaires were submitted from 2002 to 2005. Post-mentoring results indicated gains in career awareness (means of 3.84–4.23 across years) and that gains were related to the ementor (means of 3.33–4.00). Interest in career exploration also increased (means of 3.67–4.39) as did willingness to relocate for career purposes (mean of 3.64–4.15). The ementoring experience was perceived as a beneficial experience that included problem solving (38–64\%), goal identification (33–67\%), and career insight (44–72\%).

Knowing the impact of interventions and other factors enables universities and funding agencies to more effectively distribute their resources in supporting underrepresented minority students in pursuit of science careers.},

	abstract = {This article examines mentoring as a potentially useful resource in an organization's adaptation to global competition and the need for improved learning capabilities. We were surprised to find that mentoring relationships were perceived as more desirable under conditions of corporate stress, low job challenge, and low job involvement. We were further surprised to find that individuals in early and later career stages were as likely, or more likely than, their midcareer colleagues to embrace the mentoring role. Thus, it appears that mentoring may be more readily available as an antidote to stress than previously considered, and that it may be an important form of coping with the stressful, nonrewarding conditions that typically characterize corporate downsizing. Not only is mentoring an important form of promoting development (for self and for others), but it also may represent a valuable vehicle for social support and learning during times of major corporate change.},

	abstract = {Many students do not receive the adequate academic and social support during their enrollment in a higher education institution that could positively impact their abilities to succeed in college (Astin, 1984; Hurtado \& Carter, 1997; Nora, 1987; Pascarella \& Terenzini, 1991). These support systems can be viewed as providing a holistic mentoring experience to students. Because of the many possible benefits to be derived from mentoring, the study of effective mentoring of undergraduates is paramount. Unfortunately, the utility of existing mentoring studies is limited due to definitional, methodological, and theoretical flaws (Jacobi, 1991). The purpose of the present study was to identify the multi-dimensions associated with mentoring through a proposed conceptual framework. Four major domains were identified in the literature: 1) psychological or emotional support, 2) goal setting and career paths, 3) academic subject knowledge support, and 4) the existence of a role model. Secondary data were analyzed from a sample of 200 students at a two-year institution in the south-central area of the United States in the 1997 academic year. Three statistically reliable latent variables (educational/career goal-setting and appraisal, emotional and psychological support, academic subject knowledge support aimed at advancing a student's knowledge relevant to their chosen field) were identified as comprising the mentoring experiences of the survey participants. Findings suggest that mentoring programs aimed at providing experiences designed to assist students in adjusting to college life and becoming fully engaged in classroom and out-of-class activities should focus on providing support for the latent variables identified.},

Additionally, we examine from the perspective of those who mentor protégés of color, whether their relationship satisfaction is associated with having a protégé who is similar or different with regards to race/ethnicity and perceived value similarity. Finally, we consider the mediating roles of interpersonal comfort and commitment. Our results indicate that graduate students of color receive more psychosocial and instrumental support from, and are more satisfied with mentors of color. Further, interpersonal comfort and commitment mediate the relationships between surface and deep-level similarity and mentoring outcomes.},

Analyses used baseline and follow-up data from over 9,000 youth who participated in community-based mentoring programs in the northeastern United States, as well as their volunteer mentors. Racial and ethnic similarity between mentor and youth was predictive of longer match duration. Moreover, a shared dislike of activities was associated with longer matches than either shared interests or discordant interests in activities.

It was hypothesized that the relationship of similarity with mentoring received would be moderated by duration of the relationship. Specifically, the authors expected that gender and race dissimilarity would lead to less mentoring early in the relationship, but that such effects would dissipate later in the relationship. Furthermore, the authors predicted that perceived similarity, conceptualized as underlying similarity of attitudes, values, and beliefs, would be more strongly related to outcomes for longer duration vs shorter duration dyads. Data were collected on 220 student-advisor dyads. Students (aged 23-60 yrs) were surveyed on their perceptions of the relationships. Demographic data were also collected from both students and their advisors (aged 34-73 yrs). Results show that, in general, duration of the relationship moderated the effects of gender similarity and perceived similarity on mentoring received, although the pattern of means was more complex than originally hypothesized.

Students in the treatment condition received feedback on 5 similarities that they shared with their teachers; each teacher received parallel feedback regarding about half of his or her 9th grade students. Five weeks after our intervention, those in the treatment conditions perceived greater similarity with their counterparts. Furthermore, when teachers received feedback about their similarities with specific students, they perceived better relationships with those students, and those students earned higher course grades.

But with a plethora of research being conducted in three primary areas (youth, student-faculty, and workplace mentoring), little attention has been paid to the potential advantages of looking across these different types of relationships to provide a more unified and comprehensive understanding of mentoring. Cutting across the fields of psychology, management, education, counseling, social work, and sociology, The Blackwell Handbook of Mentoring reveals an innovative, multi-disciplinary approach to the practice and theory of mentoring. In this volume, leading scholars working in each of the three key areas review the critical literatures from their field. Focusing on today's most substantial theoretical approaches and methodological issues, this book combines original theory and landmark research, with 20 years of accumulated observations to provide rich and incisive analysis. With a final section that presents an integrated perspective on mentoring relationships and projects a future agenda for the field, this volume is the most complete guide to the subject to date, making it an essential resource for all students, researchers, and related professionals who are looking to stay at the forefront of the discipline.

This study uses virtual mentoring as a tool to aid undergraduate STEM students in obtaining information on graduate school because mentoring is a crucial element in preparing African American students for tenured positions. The focus of study of the study is to compare which conversational agent interface, the Twitter Conversational Agent or Embodied Conversational Agent, the users find the most effective. The sample is composed of 37 African American HBCU male undergraduate students who are STEM majors and interested in graduate school. The participants must already use Twitter. The same number of students (37) used in Gosha’s study will be used for this study in order to receive an accurate comparison between the TCA and ECA. The study has not been executed yet, but it is intended to be executed soon.},

Sites such as Fanfiction.net host millions of stories, with thousands more posted each day. Enthusiasts are sharing their writing and reading stories written by others. Exactly how does a generation known more for videogame expertise than longform writing become so engaged in reading and writing in these communities? Via a nine-month ethnographic investigation of fanfiction communities that included participant observation, interviews, a thematic analysis of 4,500 reader reviews and an in-depth case study of a discussion group, we found that members of fanfiction communities spontaneously mentor each other in open forums, and that this mentoring builds upon previous interactions in a way that is distinct from traditional forms of mentoring and made possible by the affordances of networked publics. This work extends and develops the theory of distributed mentoring. Our findings illustrate how distributed mentoring supports fanfiction authors as they work to develop their writing skills. We believe distributed mentoring holds potential for supporting learning in a variety of formal and informal learning environments.},

	abstract = {Formal mentoring is an increasingly popular tool for professional development and socialization, particularly in higher education, where expertise is contextual and dynamic. As it is currently enacted, however, mentoring suffers from a lack of clarity, as each participant – protégé or mentor –seems to have a different understanding of what mentoring is or should be. If mentor and protégé don’t have the same understanding, necessary mentoring may not take place. The challenge for researchers is that the action of mentoring usually takes place in dyadic privacy. Studies of mentoring therefore focus on outcomes and participant satisfaction, without being able to separate the links between mentoring functions and those outcomes. In this paper I propose a model of the mentoring relationship that describes the information practices of mentoring. This model is derived from a study of faculty mentors at a large mid-Atlantic university. The model will extend our understanding of mentoring by applying the concept of information practices to the mentoring process.},

	abstract = {This review critically examines 15 empirical studies, conducted since the mid 1980s, on the effects of support, guidance, and orientation programs— collectively known as induction — for beginning teachers. Most of the studies reviewed provide empirical support for the claim that support and assistance for beginning teachers have a positive impact on three sets of outcomes: teacher commitment and retention, teacher classroom instructional practices, and student achievement. Of the studies on commitment and retention, most showed that beginning teachers who participated in some kind of induction had higher job satisfaction, commitment, or retention. For classroom instructional practices, the majority of studies reviewed showed that beginning teachers who participated in some kind of induction performed better at various aspects of teaching, such as keeping students on task, developing workable lesson plans, using effective student questioning practices, adjusting classroom activities to meet students’ interests, maintaining a positive classroom atmosphere, and demonstrating successful classroom management. For student achievement, almost all of the studies showed that students of beginning teachers who participated in some kind of induction had higher scores, or gains, on academic achievement tests. There were, however, exceptions to this overall pattern – in particular a large randomized controlled trial of induction in a sample of large, urban, low-income schools — which found significant positive effects on student achievement, but no effects on either teacher retention or teachers’ classroom practices. Our review closes by attempting to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings and also by identifying gaps in the research base, and relevant questions that have not been addressed and warrant further research.},

	abstract = {Programming is central to Computer Science and cognate disciplines, and poses early-learning challenges in problem-solving and coding. Since the recent past the School of Computer Science \& Information Technology (RMIT University) has provided a student mentoring service to assist novice student programmers with their programming, indeed, to build up their conﬁdence in programming. The service has received favourable feedback from students and, as an interesting aside, has had the added beneﬁt of increasing mentors’ conﬁdence and improving mentors’ communication skills. Mentors volunteer their services under a University leadership initiative, and are not paid to assist students. In light of such success, we secured a University action-research teaching and learning grant, to investigate aspects of the service delivered to date. While mentoring has been shown to be helpful for novice student programmers to learn and improve their programming, less recognised, but of equal importance, is the value to mentors through the skills and experience they gain. This paper reports early ﬁndings of a dual-purpose research investigation into the mentoring service. The research project seeks to discover ways to improve the mentoring service for novice student programmers, as well as to enhance a range of qualities in mentors.},

The learner matching system builds a knowledge model for each programmer by analyzing their authored code and extracting features that capture domain knowledge and style. We demonstrate the feasibility of a simple model that counts the references to modules from the standard library and Python Package Index in a programmers’ code. We also show that programmers exhibit self-selection using which we can extract the modules a programmer is best at, even though we may not have all of their code. In our future work we aim to extend the model to encapsulate more features, and apply it for skill matching in a programming class as well as personalizing answers on StackOverﬂow.},

Mentors in the workplace are crucial in such cooperative programmes as they scaffold appropriate development activities for students. A workplace mentor in this situation is important not only for the development of detailed technical knowledge, but also in the development of software engineering skills that are almost never in fact taught in higher education, e.g. navigating large, neglected code bases. Consequently, workplace mentors are a key component of any high-quality education programme delivered in partnership with industry. However, higher education institutions and enterprises not only need to appreciate the importance of mentors in such schemes, but also ensure such staff are supported to use their experience to increase their skill as a mentor. Mentors need the space and support to reflect on their own practice, develop skills and attain new knowledge. In this sense, the challenge is not dissimilar to that faced by computing science school teachers that need to continually consider their own practice as well as have the time to consider emerging programming languages and frameworks. Many of the structures and existing research on how to support computing science school teachers could be adapted to support these workplace mentors, e.g. support groups.},

	abstract = {Two-Sided Matching is a well-established approach to find allocations and matchings based on the participants' preferences. While its most prominent applications are College Admissions and School Choice problems, this paper applies the concept to the matching of mentors to mentees in a higher education context. Both mentors and mentees have preferences with whom they ideally want to be matched, as well as who they want to avoid. As the general formulation for these types of preferences is NP-hard, several existing approximation algorithms and heuristics are compared with respect to their ability to find a matching with desirable properties. The results show that a combination of evolutionary heuristics and local search approaches works best in finding high-quality solutions, allowing us to find mentor-mentee pairs which are close to the respective ideal match.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT A method for matching leadership mentors with beginning teachers is described in this paper, with emphasis on personality types and psychosocial characteristics. A review of literature on guide matching concludes that research is inconclusive and that matching is often based on availability. Five fundamental assumptions of the personnel matching approach are then outlined. Four mentor-protege styles are described: supportive, directive, facilitative, and scientific. An instrument, which is an adaptation of the Sayers-Kirsch Leadership Matrix (1978), is being developed and pilot tested for the placement of individuals into one of the four groupings. A conclusion is that mentoring is not dependent upon participants' sharing similar leadership styles, but upon the ability to build upon sameness or diffetence. A behavioral characteristics rating form is included, (LMI)},

	abstract = {Group work is used as a means for learning at all levels in educational systems. There is strong scientific support for the benefits of having students learning and working in groups. Nevertheless, studies about what occurs in groups during group work and which factors actually influence the students’ ability to learn is still lacking. Similarly, the question of why some group work is successful and other group work results in the opposite is still unsolved. The aim of this article is to add to the current level of knowledge and understandings regarding the essence behind successful group work in higher education. This research is focused on the students’ experiences of group work and learning in groups, which is an almost non-existing aspect of research on group work prior to the beginning of the 21st century. A primary aim is to give university students a voice in the matter by elucidating the students’ positive and negative points of view and how the students assess learning when working in groups. Furthermore, the students’ explanations of why some group work ends up being a positive experience resulting in successful learning, while in other cases, the result is the reverse, are of interest. Data were collected through a study-specific questionnaire, with multiple choice and open-ended questions. The questionnaires were distributed to students in different study programs at two universities in Sweden. The present result is based on a reanalysis and qualitative analysis formed a key part of the study. The results indicate that most of the students’ experiences involved group work that facilitated learning, especially in the area of academic knowledge. Three important prerequisites (learning, study-social function, and organization) for group work that served as an effective pedagogy and as an incentive for learning were identified and discussed. All three abstractions facilitate or hamper students’ learning, as well as impact their experiences with group work.},

Our conclusion in this paper is that Scrum is so useful because it provides effective communication in the form of boundary objects and boundary spanners, it provides effective social integration by building up social team capital, and it provides much needed control and coordination mechanisms by allowing both local and global articulation of work in the project. That is why Scrum is especially useful for distributed IS project management and teamwork},

Several recent surveys show that agile methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming and, more recently, Kanban have been successfully adopted by many companies to develop their software. However, the same surveys show that only few of the agile practices are used and even fewer are applied consequently and thoroughly. This is to a great extent due to the lack of skilled personnel. Although teaching agile software development has drawn some attention in recent research and has been discussed in several papers, we do not yet seem to be able to “deliver” the appropriately skilled personnel. What is the reason for this, and more importantly, how can we improve the situation? In this paper we propose a more holistic approach for teaching agile software development, in which the required agile practices and values are not only integrated theoretically into our courses but also practically applied and repeated until they become a habit to our graduates. The proposed concept was realized in a new Software Engineering course held at Zurich University of Applied Sciences during 2012. The evaluation shows very encouraging results, but also leaves some challenges and problems to be solved.},

An evaluation study involved comparing pupils in SPRinG classrooms and trained in group work skills with those who were not in terms of science attainment. There were 560 and 1027 pupils (8-10 years) in the experimental and control groups respectively. 'Macro' attainment data were collected at the start of the year. 'Micro' attainment data were collected in the spring and summer before and after science lessons involving either group work (intervention) or the control teachers' usual approach. SPRinG pupils made greater academic progress than control pupils. Findings are discussed relative to enhancing the quantity and quality of group work in schools and a social pedagogic approach to classroom learning.

However, all teachers did note that CL needed to be well planned, students needed to be prepared to work in groups, and teachers’ expectations needed to be explicitly stated if the benefits attributed to CL were to be realised.},

This abrupt switch had an impact on software projects. Thus, it is necessary to understand how potential future disruptive events will impact Agile software teams’ ability to deliver successful projects while working from home. To investigate this problem, we used a two-phased Multi-Method study. In the first phase, we uncover how working from home impacted Scrum practitioners through semi-structured interviews. Then, in the second phase, we propose a theoretical model that we test and generalize using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) surveying 138 software engineers who worked from home within Scrum projects. We concluded that all the latent variables identified in our model are reliable, and all the hypotheses are significant. This paper emphasizes the importance of supporting the three innate psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the home working environment. We conclude that the ability of working from home and the use of Scrum both contribute to project success, with Scrum acting as a mediator.},

Referred to as ‘free-riders’, the effect of this behaviour on other students can make group work an unpleasant experience for some. Of most frustration to students is receiving the same mark as their fellow non-contributing group members despite producing much of the group’s work. Identifying free-riding behaviour early on in a project can help reduce the impact it has on other group members. What can also be identified is that free-riding behaviour is not necessarily due to apathy or a deliberate attempt to do as little work as possible. Numerous underlying reasons can lead a student to not contribute equally to a group even if he or she is willing. This study involved surveying students (N = 205) from all faculties of an Australian university and asking them of their attitudes towards group work. Free-text responses from the students were thematically analysed, and results showed that free-riding was the greatest concern across all disciplines.},

We then investigate the applications of LLMs in various fields and domains including medicine, engineering, social science, and humanities. Our review also reveals the dynamic, fast-paced evolution of LLMs research. Overall, this paper offers valuable insights into the current state, impact, and potential of LLMs research and its applications.},

	abstract = {An important graduate attribute is the ability to work in teams, so many university courses incorporate this as part of the learning experience. However, it is inevitable that in some teams there will be members who do not contribute as much to the overall effort as others, leading to frustration in those members who carry the majority of the burden. When there are students enrolled in distance-education mode, this can be exacerbated because many of the teams cannot meet face-to-face, so it can be difficult to exert sufficient influence to force problematic individuals to amend their behaviour. In an effort to mitigate against this problem, self and peer assessment was used for both team assignments in a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) course and the results of the peer assessment were used to scale the team mark for the corresponding assignment to obtain individual grades. After submitting their final assignment, a survey instrument was used to investigate the success of this process. The students overwhelmingly supported the idea of distributing marks based on the value of the individual's contribution because in many teams it had the desired effect of motivating underperforming members to involve themselves more in the second assignment. There was some dissatisfaction about the process used to distribute marks, which the authors will attempt to address by providing better scaffolding in subsequent uses of the software tool. Regardless of these difficulties, we found that a transparent mechanism for distributing team marks to individual grades is beneficial for encouraging equal commitment to the team effort by all team members.},

To realize these gains, students must all contribute. Strategies like assigning roles, group contracts, anonymous peer evaluations, and peer ratings all encourage student participation. In a class using these strategies, we conducted in-depth interviews to uncover student perceptions of group work in general and the utility of these support strategies. Students in both high- and low-performance groups still complained of unequal contributions while praising the social support provided by groups. Students who scored highly on tests were more likely to recognize the benefits of group work, regardless of their groups’ overall performance levels, while lower-scoring students perceived group work as time-consuming “busy work” with little cognitive benefit. Comments from anonymous peer evaluations differed only subtly between high- and low-performance groups. Numerical ratings on these evaluations did correlate with overall group performance. However, students in lower-performance groups assigned harsh ratings to their low-scoring members, while students in higher-performance groups were more generous in their ratings for low-scoring members. We discuss implications of relying on support strategies for promoting productive group work.},

Deductive content analysis attained condensed and broad descriptions of participants’ workplace experiences. Results: Dyslexic adults (n = 14) participated; majority employed part/full-time and experienced challenges throughout their employment; exhaustion and burnout at work were reported, also fear and indecision about disclosure of dyslexia. A minority reported receiving positive, useful support from team members following disclosure. Conclusion: The JD-R Model provided a guiding framework. We found participants experienced a myriad of challenges that included risk of mental exhaustion, discrimination, limited access to support and fatigue, leaving them vulnerable to job burn-out. Dyslexia does not have to be a major barrier to success in any occupation. Yet, when in supportive, informed workplace environments, employees with dyslexia thrive.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examines the difference between college students with and without Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in regard to their work performance. Method: A series of ANOVAs analyzed group differences in symptoms experienced at work. The independent variable was group (i.e., ADHD, Controls). The dependent variables include items from Barkley’s “Work Performance Rating Scale” (Barkley \& Murphy, 1998), which assesses the degree to which symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity are evident on the job. For the group with ADHD, the relationship between symptom severity and indicators of work performance (e.g., number of times fired, overall rating of work performance) was also examined, using correlational analyses. Descriptive analyses were also used to examine which items were most frequently endorsed by the group with ADHD, as well as which areas of work were most affected by ADHD symptoms. Results: Results reveal that ADHD has a detrimental impact on the work performance of college students in multiple areas. Severity of symptoms was unrelated to number of times fired from a job and the overall indicator of work performance. Conclusion: College students with ADHD do exhibit more on-the-job difficulties than their non-ADHD peers, and thus may require extra support with their work-related endeavors.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive model of work-based learning is illustrated combining explicit and tacit forms of knowing and theory and practice modes of learning at both individual and collective levels. The model is designed to bring together epistemic contributions which are typically studied in isolation. The learning types produced from the model represent processes the intersection of which can contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory for integrating learning and work.

At the individual level, work-based learning might start with conceptualization which provides practitioners with a means to challenge the assumptions underlying their practice. In experimentation, they engage their conceptual knowledge in such a way that it becomes contextualized or grounded. However, within the world of practice, in applying theoretical criteria or advanced analytical techniques, one confronts technical, cultural, moral, and personal idiosyncrasies which defy categorization. Hence, experience is required to reinforce the tacit knowledge acquired in experimentation. In fact, learning acquired through experience, often referred to as implicit learning, is the foundation for tacit knowledge and can be used to solve problems as well as make reasonable decisions about novel situations. Nevertheless, reflection is required to bring the inherent tacit knowledge of experience to the surface. It thus contributes to the reconstruction of meaning.

At the collective level, conceptualization again makes a contribution in informing spontaneous inquiry but is now embedded within the more formal methods of applied science. Scientists seek to describe and explain social reality through the manipulation of theoretical propositions using the rules of hypothetico-deductive logic. The theories of applied science are often not helpful to practitioners, however, unless they are incorporated into practice. This is the purview of action learning wherein real-time experience, especially problems occurring within one's own work setting, constitutes the primary subject matter. As practitioners come together by being involved with one another in action, they may become a community of practice wherein they learn to construct shared understanding amidst confusing and conflicting data. Hence, community of practice returns knowledge back into its context such that groups learn to observe and experiment with their own collective tacit processes in action. Action science is called upon to bring the individuals' and group's mental models, often untested and unexamined, into consciousness. It is a form of “reflection-in-action” which attempts to discover how what one did contributed to an unexpected or expected outcome, taking into account the interplay between theory and practice.

Applications of the model can spur conceptual and practical developments that might lead to a comprehensive theory of work-based learning. The discussion takes up such issues as transition links between learning types, their segmentation by function or process, and implications for epistemology. A sample program, incorporating many of the learning types in the model, is demonstrated. The paper argues that all eight types of learning need to be brought into consideration if learners are to achieve proficiency and become critical while learning at work.},

Sex differences in the access to and availability of four sources of information important to the development of strong expectations of personal efficacy are reviewed and discussed in relationship to women's career decisions and achievements. The utility of the proposed model for integrating existing knowledge of women's career development, for generating productive avenues of inquiry, and for guiding intervention efforts is discussed.

However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.},

	abstract = {Community college students cite career advancement as their top reason for enrolling, with over 70\% of first-year students expecting to participate in an internship as part of their college experience. However, surveys indicate only between 10\% and 25\% of bachelor's degree holders participated in an internship, with Black and Latino students, women, low-income, and first-generation students having less access. With strong associations between paid internships and positive outcomes in the labor market after graduation, the impact is substantial: new grads who start out underemployed are five times more likely to remain underemployed after five years. This experience report documents a multifaceted intervention at Green River College. Partnering with Mentors in Tech provides community college baccalaureate students studying software development with structured mentorship from industry mentors who help students navigate the hiring process and landscape and bring impactful aspects of internships into capstone projects. Partnering with CodeDay provides students with accessible internships, working on open-source software. In 2022-23, this intervention reached over 90\% of students in the program, consisting of 47\% students of color, 28\% women, 59\% receiving financial aid, and 20\% first-generation college students. Initial results include a review of hiring process metrics, placement outcomes, and student reflections. Seventy-five percent of students who graduated in 2022 landed a tech role within six months of graduation. Over 90\% of participating students expressed confidence in their ability to transition from student to tech professional. Ongoing work focuses on long-term sustainability and expanding opportunities for students enrolled in similar programs at comparable institutions.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

Proponents of the neurodiversity movement, however, challenge the pathologization of minority cognitive styles and argue that we should reframe neurocognitive diversity as a normal and healthy manifestation of biodiversity. Neurodiversity proponents have thus far drawn on social-relational models of disability to challenge the medical model of disability, but they have not developed an alternative functional analysis to replace conceptions of neurological dysfunction or impairment. Here I clarify and defend the neurodiversity perspective by drawing on ecological functional models that take relational contributions to collectives, and group functioning, into account alongside individual functionality. Using the example of autism as well as recent developments in the study of cognitive diversity, I apply these models to human mental functioning and argue that what I call the ecological model has greater utility for research and practice than the leading psychiatric functional analyses of mental functioning.},

The way in which disability is understood is important because the language people use to describe individuals with disabilities influences their expectations and interactions with them.

Most recently, the medical and social models have been the two prominent models of disability discourse. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the medical and social models of disability discourse by comparing, contrasting, and critiquing the models. Further, we present practical examples using different hypothetical scenarios involving the same student with disabilities to depict how a teacher with a medical model orientation compared to a teacher with a social model orientation would interact and work with a student with a disability in physical education.},

The neurodiversity paradigm(s) can be seen as one of three perspectives; as lived experiences that informs ways of producing knowledge, of ways of looking and talking back to power – of ‘queering’ the cognitive normative gaze – and finally as an ethical stance. There may be tensions between ‘affirming’ lived experiences and ‘queering’; but both kinds of work are important, since we need to represent neurodivergent experiences and challenge cognitive norms.
                     Somewhere along the way, neurodiversity in an academic context has, up to a point, become coextensive with critical autism studies. We want to stress the importance of unpicking this, given that this orientation only addresses a limited range of neurodivergent experiences. We argued that it is essential for neurodiversity studies to consider all neurodivergent differences and not to exclude types of neurodivergence that are seen as less culturally palatable.},

	abstract = {Neurodivergent students exhibit an inclination towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, yet their learning experiences in STEM courses remain underexamined. Utilizing an online survey of neurodivergent (n = 60) and neurotypical (n = 83) US college students, this study identified various factors influencing their self-perceived learning experiences, including interest in the course content, instruction quality and performance outcomes. Compared to their neurotypical peers, neurodivergent students attributed negative experiences in STEM courses less frequently to performance-related factors and more often to a mismatch between their interests and the course content. Both groups also articulated a variety of strengths and challenges encountered in their STEM studies. Neurodivergent students were more likely to report having interest and passion for STEM and less likely to report having peer support and effective study skills and habits as their primary strength for studying STEM. Conversely, while neurotypical students cited difficult content as their central challenge, neurodivergent students more commonly faced challenges with focus and attention. Despite the study's limited sample size, it revealed emerging patterns that emphasize the importance of developing inclusive teaching methods and specific support mechanisms to cater to the unique strengths and challenges of neurodivergent students in higher education.},

From an initial data set of more than 3800 papers published in the years 2010–2019, we identify 50 papers that present a range of domain-specific theoretical constructs addressing emotions, affect, beliefs, attitudes, and self-efficacy. They include 11 validated instruments and a number of statistical models, but also grounded theories and pedagogical models. We summarize the main results of many of these constructs and provide references for all of them. We also investigate how these constructs have informed further research by analysing over 850 papers that cite these 50 papers. We categorize the ways that theories can inform further research, and give examples of papers in each of these categories. Our findings indicate that among these categories, instruments have been most widely used in further research, thus affirming their value in the field.},

While software engineering research often focuses on tools to support this problem solving, the strategies that developers use to solve problems are at least as important. In this paper, we offer a novel approach for enabling developers to follow explicit programming strategies that describe how an expert tackles a common programming problem. We define explicit programming strategies, grounding our definition in prior work both within software engineering and in other professions which have adopted more explicit procedures for problem solving. We then present a novel notation called Roboto and a novel strategy tracker tool that explicitly represent programming strategies and frame executing strategies as a collaborative effort between human abilities to make decisions and computer abilities to structure process and persist information. In a formative evaluation, 28 software developers of varying expertise completed a design task and a debugging task. We found that, compared to developers who are free to choose their own strategies, developers given explicit strategies experienced their work as more organized, systematic, and predictable, but also more constrained. Developers using explicit strategies were objectively more successful at the design and debugging tasks. We discuss the implications of Roboto and these findings, envisioning a thriving ecosystem of explicit strategies that accelerate and improve developers’ programming problem solving.},

	abstract = {Introduction Behavioral-based interviewing (BBI) is based on the premise that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance. Many interviewers of students in the Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (ABE) Department at Iowa State University use BBI to gain detailed job-related examples from a candidate, and to assess past performance and competencies. One technique of preparing for BBI experiences is the STAR method examples of competency demonstrations that include a situation or task, the specific action taken, and the result of the action. ABE students, starting their freshman year, develop a “library” of STARs that encompass the 14 competencies central to the ABE outcomes assessment program. Students develop, reflect upon, and update these STARs throughout their academic careers and include them in their electronic portfolios. They use their STARs to prepare for career interviews that use BBI. Integrating BBI and STAR into the curriculum helps students focus and reflect upon their past experiences and how those experiences contribute to competency development their success as practicing professionals. Career interviews for engineering and technology students are evolving from interrogation sessions to structured conversations. This evolution is facilitated by the proliferation of information technology that has automated many of the previously manual tasks such as reviewing resumes and scheduling interviews. This frees recruiters to spend more time networking and building relationships with job candidates (Burton, 2003). The real impetus for this evolution is the realization that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance (Byham and Pickett, 1997). And after all, future performance iswhat any interviewer is trying to ascertain. The structured conversation approach to interviewing, commonly referred to as Behavioral Based Interviewing (BBI), aims to discover and examine examples of past behavior through guided questioning. The traditional interview is oriented to revealing personality traits, whereas BBI is oriented to the demonstration of competencies. Competencies are application of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values, and behaviors (Elwell, 1984), and are now the focus of many companies' hiring and employee assessment processes. Typical competencies might include innovation, analysis and judgment, teamwork, and communication. By assessing competencies, the interviewer increases the consistency among interviews to avoid interviewing bias, and allows the interviewer to make decisions based on standard, objective assessment criteria. Development Dimensions International, Inc., a global provider of competency-based performance management tools and services (DDI, 2004), is a leader in teaching managers how to interview candidates. They call this method Targeted Selection®. While this technique is called by many names, the underlying premise is the same past behavior is the best predictor of future performance. Traditional interviews often include such questions as: (1) “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” (2) “Why are you interested inworking for us?” and (3) “Tell me about yourself?” While the answers may be interesting, they are opinions (even when answered truthfully) and may not predict future performance. BBI questions, however, emphasize past performance and behaviors. Typical questions in a BBI settingmight include: (1) “Think of an occasionwhen you had to deal with a difficult team member.” (2)“Tell me about a time when you had too many things to do and you were required to prioritize your tasks.” and (3) “Give me a specific example of a time when you used good analysis and judgment in solving a problem.” Figure 1 gives a comparison of the “traditional” interviewing and BBI.

While computing education researchers should draw upon this prior work, programming education is unique enough that we should explore the extent to which prior work applies to our context. The goal of this systematic review is to support research on metacognition and self-regulation in programming education by synthesizing relevant theories, measurements, and prior work on these topics. By reviewing papers that mention metacognition or self-regulation in the context of programming, we aim to provide a benchmark of our current progress towards understanding these topics and recommendations for future research. In our results, we discuss eight common theories that are widely used outside of computing education research, half of which are commonly used in computing education research. We also highlight 11 theories on related constructs (e.g., self-efficacy) that have been used successfully to understand programming education. Towards measuring metacognition and self-regulation in learners, we discuss seven instruments and protocols that have been used and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. To benchmark the current state of research, we examined papers that primarily studied metacognition and self-regulation in programming education and synthesize the reported interventions used and results from that research. While the primary intended contribution of this paper is to support research, readers will also learn about developing and supporting metacognition and self-regulation of students in programming courses.},

This grounded theory study sheds light on the various processes and contexts through which students constantly assess their self-efficacy as a programmer. The data consists of a series of four interviews conducted with a purposeful sample of nine computer science majors in a research intensive state university in the United States. Use of the constant comparative method elicited two forms of results. First, we identified six stages of doing a programming assignment. Analysis captures the dimensional variation in students' experiences with programming assignments on a detailed level. We identified a core category resulting from students' reflected emotions in conjunction with self-efficacy assessment. We provide a descriptive model of how computer science majors build their self-efficacy perceptions, reported via four narratives. Our key findings are that some students reflect negative views of their efficacy, even after having a positive programming experience and that in other situations, students having negative programming experiences still have a positive outlook on their efficacy. We consider these findings in light of possible languages and support structures for introductory programming courses.},

Recent research suggests that self-efficacy -- an individual's belief in their ability to complete a task -- can influence whether students decide to persist in CS. Studies show that students' self-assessments affect their self-efficacy in many domains, and in CS, researchers have found that students frequently assess their programming ability based on their expectations about the programming process. However, we know little about the specific programming experiences that prompt the negative self-assessments that lead to lower self-efficacy. In this paper, we present findings from a survey study with 214 CS1 students from three universities. We used vignette-style questions to describe thirteen programming moments which may prompt negative self-assessments, such as getting syntax errors and spending time planning. We found that many students across all three universities reported that they negatively self-assess at each of the thirteen moments, despite the differences in curriculum and population. Furthermore, those who report more frequent negative self-assessments tend to have lower self-efficacy. Finally, our findings suggest that students' perceptions of professional programming practice may influence their expectations and negative self-assessments. By reducing the frequency that students self-assess negatively while programming, we may be able to improve self-efficacy and decrease dropout rates in CS.},

	abstract = {Background  Co-curricular activities are often touted as valuable STEM learning opportunities in higher education settings. Particularly in engineering, industry encourage and seek students with co-curricular experiences. However, many engineering undergraduates do not regularly participate in those experiences. Some researchers have suggested that the rigors of the curriculum leave little time for co-curriculars. Yet, little research has empirically examined the reality of the undergraduate students’ involvement in co-curriculars. Thus, as an initial study, we situated our study in a large public university to explore students’ motivations for co-curriculars. In this paper we report on our efforts to understand student perceptions about the value and costs of that involvement. We considered how undergraduate engineering students used their time and what motivated them to engage (or not) in co-curriculars using Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT). Students’ motivation was investigated with a quantitative research methodology and complemented by interview data.
Results  Results of our motivation survey show that students who participated in co-curriculars perceived less cost than those who never participated. We also found that the achievement values of co-curriculars does not necessarily motivate student involvement. Interview data were used to further interpret quantitative data results.
Conclusions  In the context of study findings and existent literature, we discuss several implications for future research and practice. First, we argue for a more granular investigation of student time use and its impact on co-curricular participation. Second, despite the potential for high impact outcomes, students who have never participated perceived high cost for co-curricular engagement. Those perceptions may aggravate inequitable engagement of student populations, including historically marginalized populations in the STEM field. Third, students do not necessarily associate co-curricular experiences with the types of achievement values and learning that institutions, alumni, and industry might consider most important. Thus, to build and support co-curricular programs that provide the holistic educational experiences and learning that are anticipated, research that supports design of co-curricular programs and policies to improve engagement and persistence in those programs for all students is necessary.},

These can uncover specific needs not being addressed. Following a similar line of inquiry, prior research at Oregon State University interviewed employers, with the aim of identifying skills of concern. The current paper takes this research another step further by presenting a survey-based study aimed at quantifying the prevalence and level of employers’ desire for workers who have these identified skills. Although all skills were rated as moderately useful or better, most soft skills scored higher than most technical skills. Nonetheless, three technical skills (source code versioning, testing and agile methods) scored approximately as well as the soft skills; these three technical skills, like soft skills, were cross-cutting and applicable to more than one software development context. Further survey questions revealed that employers preferred that, to the extent that students focus on building technical skill, these learning experiences ideally should involve creating software that students can use as evidence of their qualifications.},

This is a gem of a book that every college teacher should read.” ―Ken Bain, author, What the Best College Students DoSince the original publication of L. Dee Fink’s Creating Significant Learning Experiences, higher education has continued to move in two opposite directions: more institutions encourage faculty to focus on research, obtaining grants, and publishing, while accreditation agencies, policy-makers, and students themselves emphasize the need for greater attention to the quality of teaching and learning. Now the author has updated his bestselling classic, providing busy faculty with invaluable conceptual and procedural tools for instructional design. Step by step, Fink shows how to use a taxonomy of significant learning and systematically combine the best research-based practices for learning-centered teaching with a teaching strategy in a way that results in powerful learning experiences. This edition addresses new research on how people learn, active learning, and student engagement; includes illustrative examples from online teaching; and reports on the effectiveness of Fink’s time-tested model. Fink also explores recent changes in higher education nationally and internationally and offers more proven strategies for dealing with student resistance to innovative teaching. Tapping into the knowledge, tools, and strategies in Creating Significant Learning Experiences empowers educators to creatively design courses that will result in significant learning for their students. “As thought-provoking and inspiring today as it was when it was first published, it is a ‘must’ for anyone serious about creating courses that challenge students to learn deeply.” ―Elizabeth F.

We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using GenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so. Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in GenAI are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in GenAI-assisted tasks. Specifically, higher confidence in GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, GenAI shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship. Our insights reveal new design challenges and opportunities for developing GenAI tools for knowledge work.},

However, undergraduate research experiences are often inaccessible to students, particularly in high-demand research areas and at large institutions with low faculty-to-student ratios. We present an approach to broadening participation in computer science (CS) research by integrating a research project into a standard, upper-division optimization for machine learning (ML) course. We developed mini research projects which provided students with structured guidance to a new research area. In the projects, students were introduced to a recent publication in the area through a series of guided questions and then completed one of several recommended open-ended extensions for which they submitted a final report. In contrast to many undergraduate courses or programs that are focused on research, this approach introduces research in a large course in a scalable manner, lowering the barrier to entry for students and the implementation burden for instructors. The results of our intervention revealed a positive impact on students' academic and personal development. A majority of participants who completed a project reported heightened comfort and familiarity with research, as well as benefits in their exposure to and perceptions of research. Specifically, these gains were present for two groups of students we were particularly interested in: students from HUGs and students with no prior research experience.},

A questionnaire was designed comprising Likert scale and open ended questions to capture students’ experiences of constructing experiential learning claims.,The study found that students experience several learning barriers including the diversity and complexity of reflective learning models, the solitary nature of reflective learning, problems articulating tacit knowledge in writing, emotional barriers to reflective learning, accurately recalling “historic” learning experiences and difficulties in developing the meta-competence of learning to learn.,Consideration should be given to assisting learners to develop the skills necessary to select and use reflective learning models that best fit particular experiential learning contexts. Learners should be encouraged to undertake group reflection in the classroom and in the workplace to enable them to write critical reflective narratives that have integrity. There should be less reliance on written reflective narratives to evidence tacit knowledge with consideration given to other methods such as practical demonstrations, videos presentations and interviews.,The study contributes to knowledge of the barriers that students face when constructing experiential learning claims through reflective narratives. It proposes an outline pedagogical scaffolding framework to assist learners to develop recognition of prior learning (RPL) claims to enable them to maximise opportunities for claiming credits through universities RPL processes.},

	abstract = {Graduate employability has become increasingly contentious as employers call for greater development, evaluation and benchmarking of student skills and capabilities in university courses. However, the increasing range of graduate attributes and competencies demanded by industry is further pressuring an Australian higher education sector already stretched by greater student numbers and declines in government funding. Given these circumstances, there is a need to better understand employer perspectives of the current and future value of vocational, interpersonal and generic attributes of STEM graduates. A survey of STEM graduate employers showed that vocational skills, such as graduates' abilities to contextually apply and develop knowledge, together with generic skills such as critical thinking and problem solving, were valued most highly. Conversely, self-confidence and independence, along with numeracy and related skills, were valued least by the employers. However, attributes such as flexibility / adaptability, self-confidence, personal planning and organisation and developing knowledge relevant to the position were all predicted to become significantly more valuable in a decade's time. The results of this study suggest that Australian undergraduate STEM curricula, which commonly focus on knowledge acquisition, be redesigned and restructured to provide students with opportunities to apply such knowledge more often, and in real life, industry-based contexts, such as WIL and IBL programs. Through such initiatives, together with greater dialogue and collaboration between academics and employers, employability skills and attributes can be better inculcated in undergraduates, to the benefit of graduates and society as a whole.},

However, many university students think excellent grades are the main reason they get the jobs.  The disconnect between what employers expect and what students imagine is significant to the extent that many recent university graduates are unable to be employed in the jobs they want, and many employers have challenges dealing with recent university graduates who are not work ready. In 2018, a soft skills pilot study was conducted with internship supervisors who work with the Human Development and Family Studies Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  An online survey was sent to 65 internship supervisors, and three focus group sessions were conducted as a follow-up of the survey.  In 2019, Phase 2 of this study polled 76 employers who participated in a university career fair on what soft skills they expect university graduates to have at the time of hiring.  This paper reports on findings to two questions: 1) What employers think of undergraduate university students who have completed an internship with them, and 2) What soft skills employers expect of recent university graduates who are transitioning into the workplace. Findings indicate that in addition to soft skills, employers also regard personal attributes and qualities as equally important at the time of hire.},

We collected 4 waves of data over 1 semester from 363 diverse undergraduate STEM students enrolled in a chemistry lab course. The results of analyses that examined the reciprocal relations among the variables over time (i.e., cross-lagged path analysis) suggested that identity development that involved exploration (e.g., information-seeking, reflection) was positively related to students’ beliefs about their competence and value for the STEM major and negatively related to perceptions of effort cost (drawbacks associated with time and effort) for the major. Identity development that did not involve exploration was related to low competence beliefs and high perceptions of costs for the STEM major. Competence beliefs, values, and perceptions of cost for the major were dynamically related to chemistry achievement and to students’ intentions to leave the STEM major over the semester, with different kinds of cost perceptions (drawbacks associated with effort, lost opportunities, and stress and anxiety) relating differentially to students’ intentions. The results support the role of identity development in students’ motivation for a STEM major and address a gap in the literature regarding the role of perceived cost in students’ academic choices.

The authors divide the chapter into four major sections: theories focused on expectancies for success (self-efficacy theory and control theory), theories focused on task value (theories focused on intrinsic motivation, self-determination, flow, interest, and goals), theories that integrate expectancies and values (attribution theory, the expectancy-value models of J. S. Eccles et al., N. T. Feather, and H. Heckhausen, and self-worth theory), and theories integrating motivation and cognition (social cognitive theories of self-regulation and motivation, the work by P. H. Winne \& R. W. Marx, J. G. Borkowski et al., P. R. Pintrich et al., and theories of motivation and volition). The authors end the chapter with a discussion of how to integrate theories of self-regulation and expectancy-value models of motivation and suggest new directions for future research.

However, integrating such projects in classrooms requires substantial logistical planning by instructors as well as adequate programming skills from students. To mitigate these challenges, we propose four model curricula to serve as accessible strategies of integrating practicable learning opportunities in lower-level CS classes. Depending on classroom circumstances, instructors can assign projects that involve student contributions to OSS, custom plug-ins, simulated open source communities, or practical code excerpts. As a result, students will be able to explore the utility of CS and discover an exciting future in computing.},

	abstract = {Cronbach’s alpha is a statistic commonly quoted by authors to demonstrate that tests and scales that have been constructed or adopted for research projects are fit for purpose. Cronbach’s alpha is regularly adopted in studies in science education: it was referred to in 69 different papers published in 4 leading science education journals in a single year (2015)—usually as a measure of reliability. This article explores how this statistic is used in reporting science education research and what it represents. Authors often cite alpha values with little commentary to explain why they feel this statistic is relevant and seldom interpret the result for readers beyond citing an arbitrary threshold for an acceptable value. Those authors who do offer readers qualitative descriptors interpreting alpha values adopt a diverse and seemingly arbitrary terminology. More seriously, illustrative examples from the science education literature demonstrate that alpha may be acceptable even when there are recognised problems with the scales concerned. Alpha is also sometimes inappropriately used to claim an instrument is unidimensional. It is argued that a high value of alpha offers limited evidence of the reliability of a research instrument, and that indeed a very high value may actually be undesirable when developing a test of scientific knowledge or understanding. Guidance is offered to authors reporting, and readers evaluating, studies that present Cronbach’s alpha statistic as evidence of instrument quality.},

Fortunately, recent research is emerging on cost, but no clear consensus has emerged for operationalizing and measuring it. To address this shortcoming, we outline a comprehensive scale development process that builds and extends on prior work. We conducted a literature review of theory and existing measurement, a qualitative study with students, a content alignment with experts, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and a correlational study. In the literature and across our studies, we found that cost was salient to students, separate from expectancy and value components, contained multiple dimensions, and related to student outcomes. This work led to proposing a new, 19 item cost scale with four dimensions: task effort cost, outside effort cost, loss of valued alternatives cost, and emotional cost. In addition, to extend existing cost measures, careful attention was taken to operationalize the cost dimensions such that the scale could be easily used with a wide variety of students in various contexts. Directions for future research and the implications for the study of motivation are discussed.},

Due to the relation of writing in general, and reflective writing in particular, to knowledge production — writing may foster reflective learning and thinking in various academic domains. However, while adults may be either inclined or trained towards writing-to-reflect, children need to be educated to engage in it. The aim of the technique presented in this chapter is to offer a strategic framework for structuring \& facilitating reflective writing for school children. It comprises nine writing-to-reflect acts: (1) Coordinating expectations from the learning resource at hand; (2) Relating it to prior knowledge; (3) Detecting \& diagnosing difficulties in it; (4) Selecting relevant knowledge; (5) Judging the value of the learning source critically; (6) Deliberating its optional interpretations; (7) Transforming its structure conceptually; (8) Re-contextualizing the newly gained knowledge; (9) Linking: Assessing learning outcomes \& creating new learning goals. The learners use these nine ‘reflection stops’ as optional writing opportunities. They select one or several of the ‘stops’, and start writing about a text they learn from, ‘entering’ and ‘re-entering it by performing the reflective acts each selected stop entails. Wide use of this technique from second to seventh grade has shown that the majority of children \& teachers may benefit from using it- when it is introduced gradually and exercised flexibly andjudiciously.},

Students were asked to keep a journal throughout their clinical experience according to a set of guidelines. Student journals and feedback surveys were coded and analyzed using qualitative data analysis techniques. Results demonstrated that students had a consistent focus on self-concerns and self-growth. The journal served as an outlet for student feelings and as a structured method for cognitive reflection. It provided students with a method of tracking their development throughout the clinical experience. Structured journal writing provided students with a framework for reconstructing events and thinking more critically about their actions.

Our findings validate our objectives for using structured logs and indicate that the preservice educators perceived more strengths than limitations to writing structured reflective logs.

Limitations spanned a broad range with time being the most noted limiting factor.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how reflection helps teachers to grow professionally. The common held belief among teachers is that they are growing when they get experience. Although experience is very important for the teacher development, it will not help teachers to grow unless they learn from their teaching. In order to grow teachers should never allow them to be fixed with ideas, approaches and strategies, but need to keep open to the possibilities of going wrong by questioning their teaching and reflecting on their practice. Since reflection is not a spontaneous activity, it requires time, effort and personal investment from teachers. Teachers believe that their teaching automatically help learners learn; furthermore, they often feel that they understand exactly what they are doing in the class, what impact their teaching has on the learners and know their learners’ needs and feeling. How is it possible if teachers never stop for a moment to analyze their teaching activities or critically examine their actions, intentions, motives and attitudes towards learning and learners? In fact, teachers keep on planning and teaching without reflecting on them because, they feel it is too difficult to reflect on their teaching. This paper argues that reflection is neither difficult nor impossible. On the contrary, teachers can reflect if they really want to do it. As reflection is regarded as a tool for professional development, different ways of doing teacher reflection are discussed in terms of both theoretical and practical terms.},

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this concept analysis was to describe attributes, antecedents, and consequences of reflection in nursing professional development, as well as surrogate terms and a model case to inform nursing educators, students, and nurses about developing reflective skills. Methods: Rodgers' evolutionary cycle for concept analysis was used. The published work search was conducted using five databases: Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ichushi, and British Nursing Index. The inclusion criteria were: (i) academic articles; (ii) written in English or Japanese; and (iii) including descriptions about reflection. From the pool of extant published work, 50 articles were selected for the thematic analysis. Results: For the concept of reflection in nursing professional development, four antecedents were identified: (i) theory and practice gap; (ii) expansion of the role and competency in nursing; (iii) educational and learning needs; and (iv) educational responsibility. The major attribute was the process of learning from experience, and the circular process included emotional reaction, description, internal examination, critical analysis, evaluation, and planning new action. The consequences were transforming new perspective, enhanced communication, professional development, and quality of care. Conclusion: Reflection is used as a method or tool that connects knowledge and experiences. Through the process of reflection, students/nurses become aware of themselves, which helps them review and improve clinical skills. They also become more able to communicate with patients and colleagues. Reflection enhances self-directed learning and professional maturity. Nurses who use reflection can be better positioned to provide excellent patient care.},

	abstract = {The information technology (IT) industry has the expectation that graduates of IT programs should be productive from day one with little or no additional training. In order to provide graduates who can meet this expectation, experiential learning activities are essential for today's undergraduate student. Experiential learning activities are beneficial at all course levels; however, experiences that occur early in a program are limited by the students' lack of broad-based knowledge in the field and do not provide a capstone experience. While internships and cooperative experiences are perhaps the easiest way to provide such learning activities, they may not be practical for all students. This paper addresses the benefits of developing capstone projects in conjunction with industry and how the authors develop such projects.},

The purpose of this research was to trial and evaluate a career development intervention aimed at drawing on work experiences when applying for graduate roles. Students (N?=?136) from two contrasting disciplines, Business and Physiotherapy, and two institutions participated in a two-staged intervention. A focus group was also conducted with career advisors (N?=?9) to examine student engagement with career development learning. Findings indicated that students were confident in their ability to draw on relevant work experience in job applications and showed low levels of engagement in the intervention due to time constraints from their study commitments. Despite the varied contexts of the degree programmes investigated, similarities in engagement and student feedback were noted. Factors contributing to weak engagement in career provision along with strategies for improvement are presented.},

Sixty-five undergraduate respondents answered the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) and Paulhus' (1991) Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding. The 15 scales of the JPI each yielded independent acquiescence scores and trait scores. The 15 acquiescent scores were positively intercorrelated and showed one general factor in a factor analysis. Factor scores on this acquiescence factor were related to cognitive simplicity, rigid mental organization, and intolerance of alternatives, but not to socially desirable responding or other social concerns. These results imply that acquiescence is more of a cognitive style than a social response.},

	abstract = {This review set out to review the extensive literature on response bias, and particularly dissimulating a socially desirable response to self-report data. Various terminological differences are discussed as well as the way test constructors attempt to measure or overcome social desirability response sets. As an example of the research in this field, four types of studies measuring social desirability in the Eysenckian personality measures (MPI, EPI, EPQ) are reviewed. Also studies of faking in psychiatric symptom inventories, and a wide range of other tests are briefly reviewed. Various equivocal results from attempts to determine what makes some measures more prone to social desirability than others. However there appears to be growing evidence that social desirability is a relatively stable, multidimensional trait, rather than a situationally-specific response set. Faking studies may also be used to examine people's stereotypes and images of normality and abnormality, and various studies of‘abnormal groups’ perception of normality are examined. Recommendations for further work in this area are proposed.},

Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics.

In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

	abstract = {Although a significant need exists for college students to market their job skills effectively to potential employers, no prior research systematically analyzed the quality of information included in college students’ LinkedIn profiles. This study used a marketing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of information in LinkedIn profiles posted by current and former community college students. The mixed method study analyzed 340 publicly available LinkedIn profiles for students who reported attending 89 community colleges in the United States. The results suggest many college students may not understand how to use a LinkedIn profile to market their skills to potential employers. Key sections were often left blank and profiles failed to communicate students’ unique value proposition. Content analysis revealed 75\% of profiles contained an experience section with poor to below average descriptions. Comparative analysis found profiles for unemployed individuals and those seeking a new position were significantly worse than profiles for their employed counterparts. Additionally, LinkedIn profiles for students from large community colleges had significantly more writing errors than profiles for students attending medium-size community colleges. After discussing implications of the research, recommendations based on the study’s results are suggested for career service staff, educators, and students.

	abstract = {– The purpose of this paper is to explore what motivates college students to use LinkedIn and what inhibits them from fully adopting it. , – A qualitative approach applying a “uses and gratifications” framework was used to identify the motives of and barriers faced by college students with respect to the LinkedIn usage. The study includes data collected from 30 upper-level, undergraduate business students. , – Four uses and gratifications categories emerged explaining why college students would be willing to use LinkedIn. Three categories – interpersonal communication, online identity and information – are similar to those identified for using social networks, such as Facebook, MySpace and Bebo. Career development was found to be a category gratifying only LinkedIn users. Barriers to LinkedIn adoption included students’ ignorance of the network and the erroneous perception that a presence on LinkedIn should be initiated and/or developed only after graduation. , – College students’ behavior on social networks, such as Facebook and MySpace, was extensively researched employing the uses and gratifications theory. LinkedIn has recently reached about 200 million users, of which about 30 million are college students and recent graduates. Still, students’ motives, usage patterns and barriers associated with LinkedIn have not been well-documented, which creates a gap that this study attempts to address. The aim is to shed light on what motivates students to use a professional network as opposed to using social networks and what key barriers might prevent college students from fully capitalizing on LinkedIn’s features.},
