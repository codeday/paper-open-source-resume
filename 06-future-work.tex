\section{Limitations and Future Work}

Employer commitments are a positive step, but ultimately we hope for jobs. This paper leaves open whether hiring managers actually interview students meeting their requirements and whether those interviews lead to job offers. The qualitative results would also benefit from a much larger sample of employers.

On student perception, this study only looked at whether the students who viewed hiring manager agreements demonstrated a change in motivation; it did not measure behavior change. It may also be biased by the fact that the students surveyed were all enrolled in an extracurricular program that included the opportunity to make an open source contribution. Such students may have higher motivation to contribute to open source and to take actions to obtain a career than the general undergraduate population.
