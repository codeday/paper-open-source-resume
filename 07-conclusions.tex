\section{Conclusions}

The ``bar'' for an ideal software engineering graduate is high, and, with the exception of domain knowledge, the traits that employers desire are difficult to teach through conventional assignments. Although the minimum bar to get hired is likely lower, market data show that unemployment rates are rising among recent CS graduates as AI is becoming better positioned to perform entry-level work. Educators should prepare students for the higher bar.

Bringing open source software into the classroom does seem to be a viable solution, and employer expectations for open source work are theoretically achievable, but the depth and type of engagement they would like to see are more extensive than we have observed in classroom-integrated work-based learning so far. Educators taking the open source route may wish to consider deepening their engagement. The good news is that students who learn about employer expectations seem willing to take on some open source work as an extracurricular activity, though it remains to be seen whether this leads to measurable behavior change.
