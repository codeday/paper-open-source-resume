\textbf{Theme} & \textbf{Open Source Evidence Examples} \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Problem\\ Solving\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``10 issues solved; a sufficient variety of types of issues they tackle; issues touch on different parts of the technology stack or solve different kinds of problems.; at least one issue should be labeled as medium or hard.''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``6 issues solved. The issues should be reasonably challenging (required a change across multiple modules)''\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
Initiative & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``1 example of solving a problem for the project that wasn’t directly asked for (e.g., they open and solve an issue themselves, initiate a new feature, or improve the project’s technical documentation); 2 examples of helping onboard someone into the project (e.g., answering questions on the project’s forum).''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``2 examples of a PR where the definition of `done' goes beyond the bare minimum of what is asked for in the original issue. Do they think about details that are not explicitly asked for (e.g., writing unit tests or updating documentation)? Do they consider other aspects of the product, like performance or security?''\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Teamwork/\\ Collaboration\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``2 examples of comments on a PR that is not their own, where their feedback is accepted by the other person. 2 examples of a pull request where the candidate received critical feedback and they incorporated the feedback.''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``2 examples of thorough documentation on a pull request: document the process of how they initiated the new issue/feature. [...] Even better if the issue has comments throughout the timeline of the Github thread.\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Domain\\ Knowledge\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``Experience with tools that SRE’s might use: Data Dog, Grafana, Splunk, Prometheus''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``Jupyter notebooks (API’s), Docker/Kubernetes, Node, Unix Shell''\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
Curiosity & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``2 examples of finding and filing new bugs on the project. 1 example of fixing a complex bug (getting to the root cause), where they had to explore multiple branches of possibilities. The solution is explained in a blog post, video walkthrough, or detailed pull request description.''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``2 examples of a PR where they consider multiple approaches to solving the problem. Describe the multiple possibilities in the pull request. Bonus points for making a case for your best recommendation.''\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Product\\ Sense\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``You can state your opinion on what new features should be added to an open source project you are involved in and explain why your recommendation would solve a problem for the customers/users of the product''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``You can clearly articulate the purpose of the project. You can name specific projects/organizations who use it and/or you can describe the primary use cases for a typical end user.'\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
Persistence & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}p{14cm}}``Time to completion averages to 3 months or less''\vspace{0.15cm} \\ ``1 example of a long-running PR where you follow through to the end. Even better if the issue has comments throughout the timeline of the PR.''\end{tabular} \\ \bottomrule
